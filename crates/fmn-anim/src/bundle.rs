//! The FMTL/1 segment-reconstruction law (fm-oee,
//! `docs/FMNT1_TIMELINE_BUNDLE.md`) — the ONE implementation both sides of
//! the timeline bundle share: the scene-side exporter proves against it,
//! the wasm player replays through it. A second, hand-rolled lerp
//! convention anywhere would be drift against the pinned contract, so the
//! player never interpolates records itself: it calls
//! [`interpolate_between`], which routes every field through
//! [`interpolate_fields`] exactly as
//! the contract's normative law requires — pointlike fields through the
//! path function, every other field linear, locked fields skipped, f64
//! math stored at record precision.
//!
//! The tag tables (`path: u8`, `rate: u8`) are the exporter's normative
//! catalog: [`PathFunc::Straight`] is the only path a bare tag can
//! identify (an arc carries parameters a `u8` cannot), and the rate tags
//! delegate to [`fmn_core::rate::TAG_CATALOG`]. Anything untaggable is
//! exported statefully by the writer — never guessed.
