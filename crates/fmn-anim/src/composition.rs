//! Composition — the interval algebra (§9.4, fm-hfe).
//!
//! Mirrors `manimlib/animation/composition.py` at the pinned commit
//! (`3b1b/manim @ 6199a00d4c1b1127ebe45cb629c3f22538b10e13`): one interval
//! model, three operators.
//!
//! **The interval model.** [`build_timings`] is the Reference's
//! `build_animations_with_timings`, formula for formula: member *k* occupies
//! `[start_k, start_k + run_time_k]` on the group's internal timeline, and
//! the next member starts at `interpolate(start_k, end_k, lag_ratio)` — so
//! `lag_ratio = 0` stacks every member at zero (simultaneous), `1` lays them
//! end to end (successive), and anything between overlaps them by a fixed
//! fraction of each member's own duration. The group's derived `run_time` is
//! the largest end time; a member's sub-alpha is its window position,
//! clipped to `[0, 1]`, which is what makes a short member hold its end
//! state while a long one finishes.
//!
//! **One normalized-alpha pipeline (§9.4).** A group's own alpha enters the
//! same pipeline every leaf animation uses — [`time_spanned_alpha`] then the
//! rate curve — before it becomes a position on the internal timeline. The
//! group's `lag_ratio` is *not* re-applied as a per-submobject lag: it is
//! already spent in the timings, and applying it twice is the one way to
//! double-count in this design.
//!
//! **Two deliberate divergences (D5, BN-11).**
//!
//! - *The Reference's group ignores its own `rate_func` and `time_span`*
//!   (`AnimationGroup.interpolate` overrides `Animation.interpolate` and
//!   consumes raw alpha), so `AnimationGroup(..., rate_func=there_and_back)`
//!   is silently inert. Here the pipeline runs, and a group's rate curve
//!   defaults to [`RateFunc::linear`] rather than `smooth` so the *default*
//!   composition is bit-for-bit the Reference's: members own their easing;
//!   the group's curve shapes the composition's timeline. Nested groups with
//!   independent rate functions compose exactly as written.
//! - *The Reference's `Succession` ignores its members' run times* — it
//!   picks the active member with `integer_interpolate(0, len, alpha)`, i.e.
//!   equal shares — while deriving its own `run_time` from those very run
//!   times, so `Succession(a(run_time=3), b(run_time=1))` runs 4 seconds and
//!   gives each member 2. And when one frame's alpha step crosses more than
//!   one member, the members in between are never begun or finished, so
//!   their effects vanish. [`Succession`] maps alpha through the same
//!   timings every other operator uses and walks the intermediate members in
//!   order.
//!
//! **What is *not* divergent:** each member still lands on its own
//! `final_alpha_value` at `finish` (a group's own `final_alpha_value` is not
//! a second landing point). That is load-bearing rather than incidental —
//! `FadeOut` finishes at alpha 0 precisely so a removed mobject is left in
//! its original state — and a group that overrode it would break every
//! remover it contains.
