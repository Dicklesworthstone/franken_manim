//! The grow mechanism — part of family 3 (§9.4, fm-cye), ported from the
//! pinned Reference's `animation/growing.py`: every class is a Transform
//! whose *starting* copy is collapsed (`scale(0)`) onto an anchor point,
//! optionally recolored — the [`StartPrep`] sequence, exactly the
//! `create_starting_mobject` override at growing.py:30.
//!
//! `SpinInFromNothing` does not exist in the pinned tree (the fm-cye bead
//! note records the finding); the spin-flavored entry is indication.py's
//! `WiggleOutThenIn`, which lands with the indication family.
