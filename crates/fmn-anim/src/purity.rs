//! The segment-purity classifier (§9.5, D-19, R20, fm-3xk): automatic,
//! conservative, journaled.
//!
//! Every `play()`/`wait()` segment is classified by its **effect
//! signature**. A segment is [`Purity::Pure`] when each of its frames is a
//! function of the begin-state CoW snapshot and its alpha alone: no
//! dt-updaters, no scene updaters (which subsumes `always_redraw`/
//! `f_always` — both bind as updaters), no stateful tracers (they arrive
//! with W7 as updater-bound classes and demote through the same probe),
//! no unclassified animations, no wait stop-conditions. Pure segments are
//! embarrassingly parallel across frames: worker *k* reconstructs frame
//! state from the snapshot plus α(k) and the keyed per-frame RNG fork
//! (§6.5), which [`reconstruct_pure_frame`] implements and the
//! equivalence tests hold to bit-identity against the serial path. The
//! actual multi-worker dispatch (render teams, the ordered emitter's
//! thread plumbing) is fmn-runtime's (fm-3df); the classifier, the
//! journal vocabulary, and the reconstruction contract live here.
//!
//! **The conservative rule (R20), load-bearing:** misclassification would
//! be a correctness bug, so the effect vocabulary is a closed allowlist
//! of provably-pure constructs and everything unrecognized demotes the
//! segment to stateful — unknown updater shapes, animations without a
//! declared [`AnimationSignature::Pure`], callbacks of any kind. When a
//! misclassification is ever found in the wild, its effect class is
//! demoted engine-wide until root-caused (R20's kill rule — enforced
//! operationally through the replay journal, fm-y7u, which records the
//! [`SegmentReport`] emitted here per segment).
