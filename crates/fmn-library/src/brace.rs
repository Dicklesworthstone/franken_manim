//! The native `Brace` family — a parametric path generator (§11.6, §12.3).
//!
//! The Reference renders `\underbrace{\qquad}` through LaTeX and then
//! *stretches the glyph* to the width it needs. Widening is handled by a hack
//! over six hard-coded submobject indices of that render (stretch the two
//! straight runs, shift the tips); narrowing falls through to
//! `set_width(width, stretch=True)`, which squashes the curl horizontally
//! along with everything else. Neither branch is a shape family — they are
//! repairs applied to one fixed drawing.
//!
//! Here a brace is generated, not stretched. The curl — the two end hooks and
//! the centre point — has its own size, and the straight runs absorb all the
//! width. Every curl dimension is additionally clamped to a fraction of the
//! total width, which is what makes narrow braces degrade gracefully instead
//! of folding through themselves:
//!
//! ```text
//!   cap   ≤ 0.20 · width      (horizontal reach of each end hook)
//!   waist ≤ 0.20 · width      (horizontal reach of the centre point)
//!   ⇒ cap + waist ≤ 0.40 · width < 0.50 · width = the midpoint
//! ```
//!
//! so the left hook can never reach past the centre point, at any width. That
//! is a proof, not a tuning: [`Brace`] is well-formed for every positive
//! width, and `braces_never_self_intersect_at_any_width` holds it to it.
//!
//! Behaviour Note **BN-08**: the shape is ours, so its metrics differ from the
//! LaTeX-derived original. Its scaling behaviour is better defined — the curl
//! keeps its proportions where the Reference's distorted.
//!
//! The construction is adapted from `fmd-math`'s `\overbrace`/`\underbrace`
//! band (`drawn::hbrace`), which solves the same problem for math accents.
//! That module is `pub(crate)` upstream, so the geometry is reproduced here
//! rather than called; keeping the two in the same shape is deliberate, so a
//! brace over a formula and a `Brace` under a mobject look like siblings.
