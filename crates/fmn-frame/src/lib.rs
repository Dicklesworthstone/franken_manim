//! Frame buffers, pixel formats (RGBA/RGBA16F/NV12/P010), and transfer
//! functions — the Reel substrate (§14.1, D-23).
//!
//! This crate owns the pixel-storage layer under the codecs, the
//! ordered emitter, and the negotiated ffmpeg boundary:
//!
//! - [`PixelFormat`] / [`FrameLayout`] — the negotiated-sink format
//!   vocabulary with row-stride discipline (sinks negotiate stride,
//!   internal buffers may pad).
//! - [`FrameBuffer`] / [`FramePool`] — pooled, preallocated frame
//!   storage; zero frame-sized allocations on the hot path (PG-6), and
//!   pool exhaustion is the backpressure signal, never a growth event.
//! - [`transfer`] — transfer functions applied once, natively, at the
//!   defined point, over deterministic `fmn-dmath` arithmetic (D-17):
//!   the certified canonical-RGBA path is table-driven and bit-exact
//!   on every platform.
//! - [`convert`] — the conversion kernels: linear RGBA16F → sRGB RGBA8
//!   (certified), RGB → BT.709 NV12/P010 in defined-rounding integer
//!   fixed point (standard-mode, for the ffmpeg boundary), and the
//!   RGBA⇄BGRA swizzle.
//!
//! Two structural rules hold everywhere: **orientation is always output
//! orientation** — row 0 is the top row of the delivered image, and no
//! vflip exists anywhere in the system (D-23) — and no kernel ever
//! allocates, resizes, or synchronously flushes a frame-sized buffer
//! (§14.3).
