//! The content-addressed store behind typeset, path, and render caches (§14.4).
//!
//! One persistent store, one discipline, three consumers: **typeset results**
//! (fmd-math + text layout, keyed on the string, the preamble-pack hash, the
//! font hashes, and the engine version — the dominant win, PG-7's <100 µs
//! cached path), **fetched assets** (through the `AssetFetcher` capability,
//! addressed by content hash), and **the replay journal's storage** (§13.4 —
//! segments and checkpoint snapshots under a manually-managed namespace).
//!
//! # The discipline
//!
//! - **Content-addressed on fmn-hash.** An entry's address is a SHA-256
//!   [`Digest`](fmn_hash::Digest): either the digest of canonical key material
//!   (built with [`KeyBuilder`], serialized by fmn-hash's canonical format) or
//!   the digest of the content itself ([`Namespace::put_blob`]). Filesystem
//!   paths derive **only** from validated namespace names and digest hex —
//!   arbitrary key bytes never touch a path, which is the traversal
//!   protection: there is no key that can name a path outside the store root.
//! - **Atomic writes.** Entries land once through the capability's
//!   create-if-absent publication; indexes land via `write_atomic`
//!   (write-temp + rename). A reader sees complete bytes or absence — never a
//!   torn intermediate, even under `kill -9`. Re-publishing the same keyed
//!   payload is idempotent; a different payload at an existing key is a typed
//!   [`CacheError::KeyConflict`] and cannot replace the incumbent.
//!   Before any cache read, write, listing, or lifecycle removal, every
//!   component from the owned root down is classified without following its
//!   leaf; links, Windows reparse points, devices, and wrong-kind nodes fail
//!   closed. Missing write directories are created one exact leaf at a time.
//! - **Checksums verified on read.** Entries ride fmn-hash's serial envelope,
//!   whose trailing SHA-256 covers the whole document; the envelope also
//!   records the address it was stored under, and blob entries additionally
//!   self-certify (payload digest = address). Any mismatch — flipped bytes,
//!   truncation, a valid envelope at the wrong address — classifies the entry
//!   as corrupt: it is **evicted and reported as a miss, never trusted, never
//!   fatal**.
//! - **Versioned namespaces.** A namespace is `(name, schema_version)`; its
//!   directory is `ns/<name>/v<version>`. Bumping the version is a clean
//!   invalidation — a cold directory — without touching unrelated namespaces;
//!   [`Namespace::purge_stale_versions`] reclaims the abandoned ones.
//! - **Cross-process safety.** Entry writes are atomic, immutable, and
//!   digest-addressed: keyed entries derive their address from canonical key
//!   material, while blobs derive it from their content. The first complete
//!   publication for an address wins; later writers verify that winner instead
//!   of replacing it. Ordinary put/get therefore needs no lock. Maintenance
//!   (eviction) takes an advisory lock file with wall-clock staleness breaking;
//!   the LRU index is an advisory hint that eviction reconciles against the
//!   disk truth, so a lost index is a rebuild, never corruption.
//! - **Defined eviction.** LRU-class by logical access sequence with
//!   **pinning** for in-use entries ([`Namespace::pin`]) and a config-visible
//!   size ceiling per namespace ([`NamespacePolicy`]). A `None` ceiling is the
//!   manual policy (the journal namespace: explicit lifecycle, no automatic
//!   eviction).
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! A cache is an **optimization, never an oracle**: every key includes the
//! complete semantic inputs (that is the consumer's contract, enforced by
//! construction in [`KeyBuilder`]'s canonical serialization), so a hit is
//! definitionally equivalent to a recompute and certified renders are
//! bit-identical with a cold or warm cache. Every cache failure degrades to a
//! recompute ([`Namespace::get_or_compute`] swallows storage trouble); nothing
//! in this crate can fail a render. `--clear-cache`
//! ([`CacheClearAuthorization`]) retains the path-bound owned root and
//! atomically quarantines only its managed namespace tree: concurrent readers
//! see misses and concurrent writers recreate what they need at the original
//! `ns` path.
//!
//! Root authorization and ordinary traversal protect against dangerous
//! configuration, static symlinks/reparse points, copied markers, and races
//! among cooperating FrankenManim processes. Portable safe `std` does not
//! provide the same handle-relative read/write/rename/remove primitives on
//! every supported platform, so a hostile same-user process can still replace
//! an owned-root ancestor or a checked component between classification and
//! the following path-based operation. Checks are performed immediately before
//! each operation, recursive deletion is required not to follow link-like
//! children, and clear keeps its deletion boundary to `ns`; stronger stable
//! root identity and generation binding are tracked separately.
//!
//! LRU bookkeeping uses a logical sequence counter — never wall time — so
//! eviction order is reproducible in the deterministic lab; the only clock
//! use is advisory-lock staleness, which is maintenance, not semantics.
