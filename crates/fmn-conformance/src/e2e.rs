//! The Gauntlet's scripted end-to-end scenario harness (§16.6, W10, fm-fjq).
//!
//! Everything below the unit level and above the isolated engine corpora
//! lands here: whole scenarios driven through a real user-visible surface,
//! with the run's structured log captured as a deterministic artifact and
//! any failure auto-bundled into a one-command repro.
//!
//! ## What a scenario is
//!
//! A scenario is a checked-in Rust [`ScenarioSpec`] — type-safe and
//! compile-checked, deliberately not a YAML/DSL the harness would have to
//! parse (D1: no new dependencies, no second schema to govern). A spec
//! names its [`ScenarioClass`], its [`Surface`], its [`Tier`], the
//! [`Invocation`] that drives the surface, its [`Assertion`]s over the
//! outcome, and its [`LogExpect`]ations over the captured event stream.
//!
//! ## Surfaces
//!
//! [`Surface::RustApi`] and [`Surface::CliInProcess`] are live: the former
//! drives the public `fmn-scene`/`fmn-render` lifecycle directly, the
//! latter drives `fmn_cli`'s in-process runner (never a subprocess).
//! [`Surface::PythonPending`] and [`Surface::StudioPending`] are declared
//! so the enum is stable when those bindings land — a spec on a pending
//! surface is skipped, never stubbed: the harness refuses to fabricate
//! behavior a real binding has not provided.
//!
//! ## The log contract and `LogExpect`
//!
//! The invocation records a structured event stream into its [`RunCtx`];
//! the runner persists it as deterministic NDJSON under
//! `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR/e2e_logs/` (one file per scenario per run). The
//! vocabulary rides the pipeline instrumentation of fm-bgr: the canonical
//! span names ([`spans`]) mirror `PipelineStage`/the run's lifecycle
//! points, and the canonical counter names ([`counters`]) mirror
//! `PipelineStats` field-for-field (`frames_submitted` ↔ `submitted`,
//! `frames_prepared` ↔ `prepared`, and so on), so a scenario that runs
//! `FramePipeline` records its stats with no translation layer. What the
//! contract says must be assertable is assertable: preflight counts,
//! tile-cache hits, purity classifications, engine identity, and
//! `ExecutionPlan` decisions are spans with typed fields, and
//! [`LogExpect`] is the small assertion DSL over the stream —
//! `span_present` with field predicates, `counter_ge`, `event_order`,
//! `no_event`.
//!
//! ## Assertions
//!
//! The certified path asserts through the D-16 self-golden rig
//! ([`Assertion::GoldenLock`]): every artifact the outcome names is
//! bit-locked via [`crate::golden`], so a drift is the same merge blocker
//! here as in the engine corpora. Standard scenarios assert structurally
//! ([`Assertion::Structural`]): counts, size envelopes, exit codes
//! ([`Assertion::ExitCode`]), the emitted-file inventory
//! ([`Assertion::FileInventory`]), and the NDJSON schema check
//! ([`Assertion::NdjsonSchema`]) that round-trips the captured log itself.
//!
//! ## Failure → repro bundle
//!
//! On any failure — assertion, log expectation, or invocation error — the
//! runner writes a repro bundle through fmn-scene's FMNA container
//! ([`fmn_scene::journal::ReproBundle`]): the scenario's journal, its
//! content-hashed input closure, its seed and frame rate, plus the NDJSON
//! run log. The failure report names both paths, so every red scenario is
//! a deterministic replay one command away.
//!
//! ## Regression drills
//!
//! A spec marked [`ScenarioSpec::regression`] is a *drill*: the harness
//! corrupts the run deterministically — [`RegressionKind::GoldenDrift`]
//! flips one byte of the first artifact before golden locking (always in
//! check mode, so a drill can never bless a corrupted lock),
//! [`RegressionKind::LogExpectation`] corrupts the captured log against
//! the spec's own expectation — and then expects RED. The drill is
//! confirmed only when the failure came from the injection (a vacuous
//! injection — nothing dropped because the targeted span or counter never
//! occurred — is a harness error, never a confirmation), the failure
//! artifact exists and names the scenario class, and the repro bundle
//! parses with the class in its journal. Independent failures elsewhere
//! in the same run do not block confirmation but are preserved in the
//! report. Drills are the proof that the failure machinery itself works;
//! a drill that goes GREEN is a harness alarm, not a pass.
//!
//! ## Tiers
//!
//! [`Tier::Fast`] is the per-commit default: every scenario CI runs on
//! every change. [`Tier::Full`] is the slow matrix (wide geometry, high
//! thread counts, exhaustive quality presets) and runs only when
//! `FMN_E2E_FULL=1` is set — the nightly job's gate. Tier gating is a
//! skip, never a failure.
//!
//! ## Registration doctrine
//!
//! Every feature bead that changes user-visible behavior registers at
//! least one e2e scenario here. Scenarios are data, not harness edits:
//! the catalog lives in `tests/e2e_scenarios.rs` as [`ScenarioSpec`]
//! values built on this module's API, and the harness never changes when
//! a scenario is added. Keep names in the golden rig's character set
//! (`[a-z0-9._-]`), drive determinism from [`RunCtx::seed`], and prefer
//! the canonical [`spans`]/[`counters`] vocabulary over ad-hoc strings so
//! expectations stay greppable across the suite.
