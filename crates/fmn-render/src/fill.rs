//! §10.2's fill: **nonzero-winding coverage evaluated analytically on the
//! curves** — no triangulation, no signed-alpha tricks, no orientation
//! bookkeeping.
//!
//! > Tiled scanline nonzero-winding coverage evaluated analytically on the
//! > curves: quadratic segments made axis-monotone by splitting at both
//! > tangent-extremum parameters — `dy/dt = 0` for y-monotonicity, so a scanline
//! > meets a piece at most once, *and* `dx/dt = 0` for x-monotonicity, so each
//! > column crossing is a single closed-form root; per scanline, exact segment
//! > and column intersections from the closed-form quadratic root; signed
//! > trapezoidal area accumulation per cell, with each tile's rows carrying the
//! > winding deposited to their left in closed form.
//!
//! ## Where this came from, and what changed on the way
//!
//! The algorithm is G0-8b's (`spikes/g0-8-accelerator/src/analytic_fill.rs`,
//! fm-orn), inherited rather than re-derived, together with the two rules that
//! spike paid for:
//!
//! 1. **Where an exact value is known, use it.** A column crossing's `x` *is*
//!    the boundary; re-evaluating `x(t)` to recover it puts an ulp on the wrong
//!    side of an integer, which makes the walk's stepping predicate name the
//!    column it is already in. That defect deposited a three-column span as one
//!    trapezoid — and it was wrong in the `f64` reference while `f32` happened to
//!    be right, so the two-width comparison read like conditioning.
//! 2. **A tiling test must sweep tile alignments.** Comparing the scanline and
//!    per-pixel forms over one full-width window sees nothing, because no piece
//!    ever enters at an edge.
//!
//! Three things are different here, and all three are consequences of this being
//! the engine rather than a spike:
//!
//! - **The host width is `f64`.** §6.1's numeric doctrine and [`crate::table`]'s
//!   rule are the same rule: IR tables are host structs in the semantic width,
//!   and the single-typed `f32` arrays a GPU wants are a *derived* layout. The
//!   spike stored `f32` so its CPU reference and its Metal engine read identical
//!   bytes; that is a property of the derivation, not of the table. The core is
//!   still generic over [`Real`], so the `f32` instantiation remains available as
//!   the annex's arithmetic without the annex's hardware.
//! - **Instancing is a translation, not a rebuild.** §10.8 interns outlines, so
//!   the monotone split is derived **per compiled shape**, once, and an
//!   occurrence contributes only its pixel translation — folded into the piece's
//!   polynomial coefficients at the top of a row rather than materialized as
//!   geometry. A formula with two hundred `x` glyphs splits one outline.
//! - **The tile classes are consumed.** [`crate::bin`] already answers
//!   "is this tile wholly inside this shape", and §10.4's whole point is that
//!   such a tile does not evaluate coverage at all: it fills as a vectorized
//!   span at *exactly* `1`, which is also the precondition that makes occlusion
//!   pruning bit-exact (G0-8b finding F13).
//!
//! ## The tile carry, which is the part a tiled fill cannot skip
//!
//! Coverage inside a tile is not a function of the geometry inside that tile. A
//! scanline entering the tile's left edge already carries whatever winding the
//! path deposited to the left of it, so every row needs
//!
//! ```text
//! carry(row) = Σ over pieces of (signed dy of the part of the piece in this
//!              row lying left of the tile)
//! ```
//!
//! before the first cell is read. It is computed in closed form — one root solve
//! per piece — never by walking cells from the frame's left edge, which is why
//! the fill loops over **every** piece of a path rather than only the pieces
//! whose bounds meet the tile. Binning is unaffected: a path enclosing any pixel
//! of a tile has hull bounds containing that tile, so [`crate::bin::Binning`]
//! already lists it.
//!
//! ## The two dispatch shapes
//!
//! Both are built from one routine, [`accumulate_piece_row`], because the
//! per-pixel form is the scanline form with a one-cell window:
//!
//! - [`fill_row`] — the scanline shape. One accumulator of `width + 1` cells per
//!   row and one serial prefix sum along x. This is §10.2 literally, and it is
//!   the shape the CPU engine wants: a serial prefix over a row has no occupancy
//!   to lose.
//! - [`coverage_at_cell`] — the per-pixel shape. Each pixel sums, over the
//!   pieces, "the winding that passed to my left" plus "my own cell's
//!   trapezoid", with no accumulator and no scan. It is the annex's shape: one
//!   thread per pixel, the same dispatch the stroke kernel already uses.
//!
//! In exact arithmetic the two agree term for term; they differ only in the
//! association of the sum, which is why both are measured rather than assumed
//! equal.
//!
//! ## SIMD root audit: measured and declined
//!
//! fm-4wt.2 prototyped a governed x86-64-v3 `f64x4` batch for four independent
//! integer-column roots inside one monotone piece. It preserved scalar root bits
//! and consumed every span in the original order, but two warm width sweeps
//! rejected it at every size: 2 columns took 4.05–4.14 µs versus 3.61–3.87 µs
//! scalar; 8 took 10.24–11.31 versus 9.08–9.16; the production 16-pixel tile
//! took 18.14–18.99 versus 16.24–16.40; and even 64 took 67.26–70.05 versus
//! 60.01–61.29. Packing, extracting, validating, and then performing the
//! load-bearing ordered deposits cost more than the batched square roots saved.
//!
//! No slower build-tier route is retained. The `column_roots_*` cases in the
//! existing `compositor` benchmark keep the 2/4/8/16/32/64-column scalar
//! baseline reproducible so a future SoA layout or wider retained tile can
//! reopen the decision with evidence rather than folklore.

// --------------------------------------------------- the interior colour field

/// How many boundary stations §10.2's interior field is evaluated over.
///
/// A **semantic** constant, not a quality knob: it is part of the definition of
/// the colour field, so changing it changes every gradient-filled frame's hash,
/// and it is therefore named, fixed, and journaled into the input closure rather
/// than passed in — the same standing this module's `SPLIT_EPS` and G0-6's
/// `SUBSAMPLES_Y` have.
///
/// 64 is chosen against a measurement, not a feeling. Two numbers, because there
/// are two effects:
///
/// - Stations sit at interval **midpoints**, which makes the quadrature unbiased:
///   a disc's centre reads exactly `½` at *every* station count. A left-endpoint
///   rule carries a `1/(2n)` bias that every interior point inherits — measured,
///   0.49219 at 64 stations and 0.49805 at 256.
/// - Beyond four station spacings from the ramp's **seam** (where a closed path's
///   end meets its start and the boundary colour jumps back), 64 stations agree
///   with 256 to better than `1/1020` of the parameter — a quarter of one 8-bit
///   level on the colour that reads it. At the seam nothing converges, because
///   the *data* is discontinuous there; the field stays bounded and the
///   Reference's own gradient fill has the same seam.
pub const GRADIENT_STATIONS: usize = 64;

/// §10.2's interior colour field: **arc-length-parameterized boundary
/// interpolation with mean value coordinates in the interior**.
///
/// ## What is being interpolated
///
/// Not the colour — the *parameter*. The field returns `t ∈ [0, 1]`, the mean
/// value interpolant of normalized arc length along the boundary, and the ramp
/// is evaluated at it by [`fill_rgba_at`]. Two things follow, and both are the
/// reason it is built this way:
///
/// - The field is a function of **geometry alone**, so it is keyed on the
///   geometry revision like every other derived artifact in §10.8 and survives a
///   restyle. A field that interpolated colours would rebuild whenever anything
///   changed colour, which is the one thing a gradient does.
/// - For the two-endpoint ramp the IR carries today the two formulations are
///   *identical*, not merely similar: mean value coordinates sum to one, so
///   `Σ λᵢ c(sᵢ) = c(Σ λᵢ sᵢ)` exactly for any affine `c`. When Marionette grows
///   a per-point ramp, `Σ λᵢ cᵢ` drops in with no change to the field.
///
/// ## Why mean value coordinates, and why arc length
///
/// §10.2 requires a field that is "specified, tested, and stable under
/// subdivision", and the Reference's mechanism is none of those: it triangulates
/// and lets the GPU interpolate vertex colours across the fan, so the answer
/// depends on the triangulation. Both halves of the replacement carry a
/// subdivision obligation:
///
/// - **Arc length, not parameter.** A de Casteljau split changes a curve's
///   parameterization and not the curve, so stations placed by `t` would move
///   and stations placed by arc length do not. Placement runs through
///   `fmn_geom::arclength::t_at_arc_fraction` — the same solve
///   `point_from_proportion` uses (D4: the renderer does not own a second
///   arc-length rule).
/// - **Stations, not vertices.** Discrete mean value coordinates over the
///   *anchors* would change with every subdivision, because subdivision adds
///   anchors. Over stations at fixed arc-length fractions they cannot: the
///   station set is a function of the boundary curve and its arc-length
///   parameterization, both of which subdivision preserves. This is a quadrature
///   of the continuous mean value interpolant — the boundary colour averaged over
///   viewing angle from the query point — which is the subdivision-invariant
///   object the discrete form approximates.
///
/// ## The honest limit
///
/// Mean value coordinates are defined for one closed polygon. For a shape whose
/// path has several subpaths the stations run over the whole path in order, so
/// the station polygon connects one subpath's end to the next one's start; that
/// is a specified, deterministic, subdivision-invariant field, and it coincides
/// with the region boundary exactly when there is one subpath — which is every
/// gradient fill in the corpus so far. A glyph counter or an annulus wants the
/// per-loop generalization, and that is a design step rather than a parameter,
/// so it is filed rather than guessed at.
/// The interior colour field for a non-flat fill, as a *view* over

/// For a disc it is **not** free, and pretending otherwise would be the

/// manim's *quadratic approximation* of a circle, which encloses `(π/n)⁴/6` more
/// area than the circle does — 2.5e-4 relative at the default 16 components,

/// **different shape** from the general path, by up to `r·(π/n)⁴/8` pixels of
/// edge displacement. So the disc kernel is admitted the way §10.8 admits its
/// one other approximating route — *"nearly-linear quadratic → line fast path
/// under an explicit screen-space error bound"* — except that the bound here is
/// **measured off the compiled outline** rather than assumed: [`FillKernel::select`]
/// evaluates each segment's midpoint, takes the worst radial deviation from the
/// hinted radius, scales it to pixels, and declines the hint when it exceeds
/// [`HINT_BUDGET_PX`].

/// The practical effect is the shape of the rule, not a compromise with it: a
/// `Dot` at manim's default radius (0.08 units, ~10.8 px at the Reference's
/// 135 px/unit) deviates ~0.002 px and takes the kernel; a two-unit `Circle`
/// deviates ~0.05 px and draws through the general path. Dots are what the
/// radial kernel was for.
///
/// `Arc` is deliberately absent. Filling a partial arc closes it with a chord,
