//! The retained compositor's tile cache (§10.8, D-20).
//!
//! > … completed tiles cached keyed on *(command list, resource revisions,
//! > camera revision, output transform)*; static layer runs above/below animated
//! > content cached as units. **Reused tiles are byte-identical, so reuse is
//! > PG-5-safe and works under `certified`.** A `wait()` frame reduces to clock
//! > advance plus reuse; a blinking cursor does not re-rasterize a 4K frame.
//!
//! ## The whole design is the key
//!
//! Everything interesting about a tile cache is whether its key is *complete* —
//! whether every input that could change a tile's bytes is in it. Get that wrong
//! and the failure is the worst kind available in this program: a stale tile
//! under `certified` is a wrong frame that is **bit-reproducibly wrong**, so
//! every determinism check agrees with it.
//!
//! So [`TileKey`] is built from exactly §10.8's four parts, and the adversarial
//! test in this module is one case per mutation class rather than a spot check.
//! The rule that makes it maintainable is that a key is never *assembled* by a
//! caller: [`TileKey::build`] reads the binning and the plan, so a new input
//! cannot be forgotten at one call site and remembered at another.
//!
//! ## A hit bypasses rasterization; it does not check it
//!
//! §10.8 is explicit, and it is worth restating because the lazy alternative is
//! so tempting: "a cache hit bypasses rasterization entirely rather than
//! re-rasterizing-and-comparing". A cache that rasterizes to validate itself has
//! no reason to exist, and — worse — it would make an incomplete key *look*
//! correct in testing while costing everything it was meant to save.
//!
//! ## Generic key discipline, concrete pixel reuse
//!
//! [`TileCache`] remains generic because key completeness is independent of an
//! engine's payload representation. [`PixelTileCache`] is the certified/fast CPU
//! binding: tightly packed `Rgba16F` fine tiles restored directly into a pooled
//! frame by [`crate::engine::FrameJob::render_into_cached`]. A hit therefore
//! bypasses coverage, stroke, compositing and writeback rather than recomputing
//! pixels and comparing them after the fact.
//!
//! ## Live views are never traded for reuse
//!
//! §8.2: "while a *writable* live view exists, the affected object … is
//! conservatively invalidated each frame — a live view never silently receives
//! weaker semantics to buy speed." A view can mutate points with no Stage method
//! called and therefore no revision bumped, so it cannot be folded into the
//! revision part of the key. It **poisons** the tile instead:
//! [`TileKey::build`] returns `None`, and a tile with no key can never hit.
