//! Primitive hints (§10.8): routing semantic shapes off the general quadratic
//! solver, and the rule that keeps that an optimization rather than a second
//! semantics.
//!
//! §10.8 enumerates the routing exhaustively:
//!
//! > line/polyline → capsule-distance kernel; circle/arc → direct arc kernel;
//! > rectangle/rounded rectangle → specialized coverage; dot → radial kernel;
//! > image → sampler kernel; nearly-linear quadratic → line fast path under an
//! > explicit screen-space error bound; glyph → cached path instance. Mutation
//! > through `set_points` or a writable live view invalidates the hint back to
//! > the general path.
//!
//! ## The rule that matters more than the routing
//!
//! **Correctness never depends on a hint.** A kernel selected by a hint must
//! produce the same answer the general path would, so dropping every hint can
//! only cost speed. That is what makes the invalidation rule safe to be
//! conservative about, and it is asserted directly in G0-8's spike — the `Line`
//! hint and the general quadratic solver are held to the same pixels.
//!
//! Two invalidation sources, and they are different in kind:
//!
//! - **A write demotes the hint.** Marionette already implements this by
//!   *revision comparison* rather than a dirty flag: `Stage::primitive_hint`
//!   returns the tag only while the point revision it was stamped at is still
//!   current, so all four write channels (positional transform, raw record
//!   write, `set_points`, a writable live view) demote it without any of them
//!   knowing the rule exists. This module consumes that answer; it does not
//!   re-derive it.
//! - **A screen-space bound demotes a hint the tag never claimed.** The
//!   `nearly-linear quadratic → line fast path` route is not a durable class
//!   identity, it is a per-frame numeric judgement, and it is the one hint that
//!   can be *wrong* rather than merely absent. [`Hint::for_curve`] applies it
//!   under an explicit bound (§10.8's words), computed against the actual screen
//!   scale rather than a tolerance someone picked once.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! `Image` and `Glyph` have no producer in the tree — there is no
//! `ImageMobject` and Scribe's outlines are not yet interned — so this enum
//! stops at the geometry tier's vocabulary, exactly as `ShapeTag` does. Adding
//! a variant nothing can construct would put a dead branch in every kernel
//! selector in W5.
