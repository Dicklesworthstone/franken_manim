//! §10.1's **certified CPU engine** — the arithmetic whose output *is* the
//! definition of the bits.

//!
//! Everything above this module computes coverage and colour; this module is
//! where a *frame* exists, and therefore where §10.5's parallelism contract
//! stops being a doctrine and becomes a data structure.
//!
//! ## The four properties, and where each one lives
//!
//! ADR-0010 retired §10.5's fixed-point raster boundary on measured evidence and
//! made four properties binding in its place. They are not implementation
//! details — an engine that broke one would emit a provenance manifest claiming
//! a reproducibility it no longer has — so each one has an address:
//!
//! | Property | Where it is enforced |
//! |---|---|
//! | fmn-dmath owns every certified transcendental | `fmn-geom`'s `scalar` funnel, `fmn-frame`'s `transfer`, and the repo-wide guard `fmn-conformance/tests/certified_arithmetic.rs` |
//! | No FMA contraction (§10.5d) | the same guard, over every certified crate root |
//! | Fixed-order reductions (§10.5c) | this module: [`FrameJob`]'s draw order, and ADR-0013 |
//! | IEEE-754 basic operations only | certified accumulation is `f64`; `sqrt` is the only non-arithmetic primitive, and IEEE-754 requires it correctly rounded |
//!
//! ## Why a band is the unit of parallelism
//!
//! §10.5(b) asks for tiles that are *write-disjoint* and composite in a *fixed
//! order*. Those are two different requirements and it is worth separating them,
//! because only one of them is about threads.
//!
//! Compositing order is **painter order within a tile**, and it is fixed by the
//! command list [`crate::bin::Binning`] built — a property of the scene, not of
//! the schedule. Across tiles there is no compositing at all: a pixel belongs to
//! exactly one tile, so two tiles cannot disagree about it.
//!
//! That leaves write-disjointness, which is a *typing* problem: the frame is one
//! allocation and several threads must write it. Rather than hand out overlapping
//! views and argue about safety, the engine slices the frame into **bands** — one
//! fine-tile row of pixels each — with [`slice::chunks_mut`], which yields
//! provably disjoint `&mut [u8]`. Disjointness is then something the borrow
//! checker knows rather than something a comment claims, and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
//! survives a multi-threaded rasterizer without a single escape hatch.
//!
//! Bands are handed out from a shared queue, so the *assignment* is dynamic (a
//! band full of glyphs does not stall a thread that drew empty sky) while the
//! *bytes* are not: band `b`'s bytes are a pure function of `b`, the plan, and
//! the config. That is the whole of thread-count independence, and
//! `the_frame_is_identical_at_every_thread_count` is what proves it.
//!
//! ## The raw frame is linear-light `Rgba16F`
//!
//! §16.7's certified artifact kinds are *raw frames*, *canonical PNG* and *WAV*.
//! The raw frame is the linear-light master: [`fmn_frame::PixelFormat::Rgba16F`],
//! straight alpha, output orientation (D-23 — row 0 is the top row, and there is
//! no vflip anywhere in the system). The canonical PNG is one table lookup away
//! through [`fmn_frame::convert::rgba16f_to_rgba8`], which is bit-exact by
//! construction because it does no arithmetic at all.
//!
//! Certified compositing runs in `f64` in a row accumulator and is narrowed
//! **once**, at writeback. The `f64 → f32 → f16` narrowing is a double rounding,
//! and it is recorded rather than hidden: it is deterministic on every platform
//! (both steps are IEEE round-to-nearest-even), and reaching a different `f16`
//! than a direct `f64 → f16` would require the accumulated value to sit within
//! `2⁻²⁴` of an `f16` midpoint — below the width at which the 8-bit output can
//! express a difference. The standard-only fast engine instead accumulates
//! colour and alpha in `f32`; its error is held to the versioned visual budget
//! below, while coverage and the ill-conditioned stroke-distance solve stay
//! `f64`.
//!
//! ## Point-transform SIMD audit: eliminate first, vectorize declined
//!
//! fm-4wt.1 measured the complete frame-job transform path at 8, 64, and 1,024
//! quadratic segments before retaining a kernel. The portable 1,024-segment
//! controls took 115.89 µs for translation, 193.51 µs for uniform scale, and
//! 380.20 µs for a general affine map. Uniform scale was needlessly rerunning
//! the transcendental-heavy arc-length quadrature even though it cannot change
//! normalized spans. `retains_normalized_arc_length` now admits
//! only structurally proven signed-axis similarities; the same uniform-scale
//! case fell to 140.71–141.89 µs (26.7–27.3% faster), while translation and the
//! general-affine control stayed effectively unchanged. The governed v3
//! artifact measured 129.09 µs after the change. On a loaded aarch64+NEON host,
//! the raw uniform-scale result moved from 65.68 µs to 53.76–57.27 µs; its
//! same-run general-affine control was 77.75–80.62 µs.
//!
//! A separate no-horizontal-reduction `std::simd` prototype then batched the
//! remaining array-of-structs matrix pass. At 1,024 segments, x86-64-v3 `f64x4`
//! took 4.74–4.81 µs versus 4.69–4.70 µs scalar. NEON `f64x2` sometimes won the
//! isolated kernel (2.91–3.22 µs versus 3.35–4.14 µs), but saved at most 1.23
//! µs against a 65.70 µs complete affine job and carried substantial host
//! variance. No slower or immaterial SIMD route is retained. The
//! `point_transform_{translation,uniform_scale,general_affine}_*` cases in the
//! existing `compositor` benchmark keep the exact production boundary
//! reproducible for a future structure-of-arrays layout.
