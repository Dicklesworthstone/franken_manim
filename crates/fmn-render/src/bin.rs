//! Two-level binning, per-tile command lists, and painter-order-safe occlusion
//! pruning (§10.8, §10.5).
//!
//! > Binning is **two-level**: object bounds → ~128×128 macrotiles →
//! > engine-sized fine tiles → stable per-tile command runs, sizes tuned per
//! > platform by the execution plan (§17.4), never by semantics. Command lists
//! > keep stable draw indices; transparent runs stay in exact painter order;
//! > annex binning uses deterministic count/prefix/scatter or a stable key sort,
//! > never unordered atomic appends.
//!
//! ## Order-stable by construction, not by discipline
//!
//! The determinism obligation (§10.5) is that binning output is identical at any
//! thread count. That is met here structurally rather than by locking: the
//! algorithm is a **count → prefix-sum → scatter** over instances visited in
//! painter order, so a tile's run ascends in instance index whatever partition
//! produced it, and [`Binning::build_partitioned`] takes the partition count as a
//! parameter precisely so the property is testable without threads. A partition
//! is a *slice of the instance list*, and each partition's contribution to each
//! tile is placed at an offset computed from the partitions before it — so no
//! result depends on which partition finished first.
//!
//! G0-8 proved the same CSR shape end-to-end on Metal, where the property
//! matters more: the kernel only *reads* `draws[offsets[t]..offsets[t+1]]` in
//! index order, so painter order is structural and there is no ordering decision
//! at dispatch time to get wrong.
//!
//! ## Why two levels
//!
//! One level makes every instance test every fine tile its bounds touch. A
//! 1080p frame at 16-px tiles is 8 160 tiles, and a full-screen background tests
//! all of them. The macrotile pass cuts that by the square of the ratio: an
//! instance is tested against ~128-px macrotiles first, and the fine pass only
//! considers instances the macrotile already accepted.
//!
//! The sizes come from §17.4's `ExecutionPlan` — which does not exist yet
//! (`fmn-runtime` is a skeleton), so [`Tiling`] carries defaults and takes them
//! as parameters. That is the right shape regardless: §17.4 is explicit that
//! tile dimensions are a *scheduling* choice, and the size-sweep test here is
//! what makes "tuning changes speed, never semantics" a checked claim rather
//! than an intention.
//!
//! ## Pruning has a proof obligation per skip
//!
//! The bead's rule is absolute: **when in doubt, draw.** A command is skipped
//! only when a later command in the same tile provably covers the whole tile
//! opaquely, which means all three of: the tile is geometrically inside the
//! later shape, the later shape's fill is opaque at both ramp ends, and the
//! coverage there is exactly `1` rather than an accumulation that lands near it
//! (G0-8b's finding F13 — without that last clause the pruned and unpruned
//! frames differ in the last bit of a channel and "provably unchanged" is
//! false). The interior classification and the pruning are therefore one
//! mechanism, and they ship together.
