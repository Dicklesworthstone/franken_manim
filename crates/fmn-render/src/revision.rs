//! The seven independent revision axes (§10.8), and how they are read out of
//! Marionette.
//!
//! §10.8's retained plan turns on one sentence:
//!
//! > Every renderable resource carries **independent revisions** — topology,
//! > geometry, transform, style, visibility/order, image, camera-projection —
//! > and the distinctions pay directly: a color change does not regenerate curve
//! > coefficients; a translation does not recompute an object-space arc-length
//! > table; a camera move does not re-decode font outlines.
//!
//! The payoff is entirely in the *distinctions*, so this module's job is to make
//! them nameable ([`Axis`]), comparable ([`Revisions`]), and derivable from the
//! authoritative state without any renderable ever asking "did something
//! change?" — the question that has no cheap correct answer. It asks "is this
//! artifact's key still the key I built it under?", which is a comparison of
//! seven integers.
//!
//! ## Where the numbers come from, and where they do not
//!
//! Marionette carries per-field revision counters on the `RecordBuffer`
//! (`record.rs`) plus fm-7if's independent affine placement revision on every
//! entry. Six of the seven axes read from that machinery plus the family,
//! uniforms, and immutable image-resource replacement counter. One is produced
//! elsewhere:
//!
//! - **`Camera` is produced by Lumen, not Marionette.** A [`Stage`] does not own
//!   the camera, so [`Revisions::read`] deliberately leaves that axis at zero.
//!   The capture boundary composes it with
//!   `with_camera(camera.revision())`; [`crate::Camera::revision`] covers frame,
//!   projection, resolution, sampling, background, and movable-light state.
//!
//! ## The counting rule
//!
//! Revisions are compared, never ordered: an artifact is stale iff any axis it
//! depends on differs from the axis value it was built at. Monotonicity is
//! therefore not required, and this matters — `RecordBuffer::swap_in` bumps
//! every counter past the old ones on a resize, and a *different* buffer
//! generation can legitimately restart. [`Revisions`] folds the storage identity
//! into the axes for exactly that reason.
