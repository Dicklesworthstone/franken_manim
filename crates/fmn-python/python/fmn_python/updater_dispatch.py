"""Public child-update dispatch with one deferred native pass per invocation.

Python owns virtual calls and updater-list snapshots. Native updater slots are
run only after the host traversal returns, with no Stage borrow across Python.
Invocation state never enters an object's copied/pickled attribute dictionary.
Public scene updates share one host/native boundary across camera and roots.
The native scheduler may opt into that same boundary when a public override
requires it; unchanged scenes retain the existing native updater dispatch.
