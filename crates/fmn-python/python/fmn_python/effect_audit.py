"""Scene effects of certified portal renders (plan §15.5 and §16.7 C6).

A certified manifest claims that its output is a function of its input
closure. Python scene code can read any file, start processes or open
sockets, and none of that reaches the closure by itself. While a reproducible
render is active, this module observes CPython's audit events (PEP 578):

- every regular file the scene opens for reading is hashed when it is opened
  and becomes a C6 input named ``read/<sha256>/<basename>``. It is hashed
  again before publication, so an input that changes during the render is
  refused rather than misrecorded;
- effects the closure cannot capture refuse certification: a read of a
  missing or non-regular file, a directory listing, a subprocess, a network
  connection or name lookup, and an SQLite connection.

These are not scene inputs:
- reads by the import system, which SceneSource and the runtime identity
  govern;
- reads inside the interpreter's library directories and the portal package;
- source-line reads for diagnostics;
- the portal's own provenance reads, which run under ``paused()``.

Environment, clock and entropy reads raise no audit events and are not
observed. The hook is installed once, on the first certified render, and
costs one global check per audit event while no render is being recorded.
