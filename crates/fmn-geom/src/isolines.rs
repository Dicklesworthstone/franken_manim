//! Scalar-field isolines (§7.7): the owned adaptive quadtree isoline
//! extractor `ImplicitFunction` rides — displacing the `isosurfaces`
//! package, whose `min_depth`/`max_quads` knobs are honored as **budget
//! semantics**: the knobs bound work; they do not promise a particular
//! mesh.
//!
//! Everything the original left underdefined is defined here.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! * **Field.** `f(x, y) − level` is evaluated at quadtree corners and
//!   centers, memoized by exact coordinate bits — the field MUST be pure
//!   for output to be deterministic (same field + range + config ⇒
//!   identical curves, byte-for-byte, on every platform).
//! * **Refinement.** Breadth-first from the root, children pushed in the
//!   fixed order BL, BR, TL, TR. A cell subdivides when `depth <
//!   min_depth`, or when it is larger than `10·tol` per axis and either
//!   *straddles the defined/undefined boundary* (some corner values
//!   non-finite) or *crosses the level set* (corner above-ness differs).
//!   `tol` defaults to `(pmax − pmin) / 1000` per axis, the original's
//!   default.
//! * **Budget.** Subdivision stops when the leaf count reaches
//!   `max(4^min_depth, max_quads)` — `min_depth` takes precedence over
//!   `max_quads`, exactly the original's rule. When the budget binds,
//!   refinement stops in breadth-first order: regions later in the BFS
//!   queue stay coarser. This is the whole truncation story; there is no
//!   retroactive coarsening. Subdivision is indivisible (one leaf becomes
//!   four), so a budget that is not `1 mod 3` can leave up to two slots
//!   unused; the reported leaf count never exceeds it. Declared hard
//!   caps bound both storage and callbacks: [`MAX_ISOLINE_LEAVES`] and
//!   [`MAX_ISOLINE_EVALUATIONS`]. `4^min_depth` and `max_quads` beyond
//!   the leaf cap are typed refusals, and exhausting the callback cap is
//!   [`IsolineError::EvaluationBudget`]. A custom `tol` must be finite
//!   and strictly positive per component (anything else is
//!   [`IsolineError::Tolerance`]); the crossing search itself caps at 64
//!   halvings so float stagnation below a sub-ulp tolerance cannot hang
//!   it. These are the DoS bounds: no input makes the extractor run
//!   unbounded.
//! * **Above-ness.** A corner is *above* iff its value is finite and
//!   non-negative (`f(p) >= level`) — an exact zero counts as above,
//!   because the zero corner IS the level set. That choice is load-
//!   bearing: with zeros grouped below, a contour passing exactly
//!   through a grid point produces degenerate zero-length segments and
//!   three-way joints; grouped above, exactly two segments meet at an
//!   exact-zero grid point and chains pass through cleanly. (The
//!   original's binary search groups zero with negatives for the search
//!   direction only; its topology is undefined here.)
//! * **Undefined regions.** A cell whose corners are all non-finite
//!   produces no segments and never subdivides (the function is simply
//!   absent there). A cell straddling the boundary subdivides like a
//!   crossing cell, resolving the boundary to the budget. An edge
//!   produces a crossing only when **both endpoints are defined** and
//!   exactly one is above — a crossing suppressed by an undefined
//!   endpoint breaks its segment, and a lone crossing draws nothing.
//! * **Crossing placement.** Binary search along the edge down to
//!   `tol` per axis (the original's refinement), then linear
//!   interpolation for the final point — kept only when the point is a
//!   genuine zero (exact hit, or sign-consistent with a bounded value).
//!   The guard is the asymptote rule: a sign flip across `1/(x·y)`-style
//!   blowups registers no crossing. Both cells sharing an edge compute
//!   the same crossing bit-for-bit, so segments join exactly.
//! * **Segments.** The leaf quads are decomposed into a conforming
//!   simplicial partition (Manson & Schaefer, "Isosurfaces over
//!   simplicial partitions of multiresolution grids" — the original's
//!   mechanism): every internal leaf-leaf adjacency fans four triangles
//!   between the two cell centers, the shared edge's endpoints, and the
//!   edge's evaluated midpoint, so finer cells' T-junctions are sewn
//!   exactly (adjacent triangles share vertices bit-for-bit; no cracks
//!   at depth transitions). Each crossing triangle emits one segment,
//!   oriented so the *above* region (`f > level`) lies on its **left**.
//!   Closed curves therefore wind with the above region outside-left —
//!   a circle with above outside has negative signed area (clockwise).
//! * **Curves.** Segments join by exact point identity into curves:
//!   chains start from the lowest-index unused segment and extend
//!   forward then backward; a chain whose ends meet closes. At a
//!   non-generic joint (more than two segments at one point) the
//!   lowest-index segment chains first. Empty curves are dropped.
//! * **Boundary.** A deliberate improvement over the original: boundary
//!   leaf edges get the interior half of the same fan (center, corners,
//!   edge midpoint), so the mesh covers the whole domain and curves
//!   reach the boundary exactly; the original leaves an untriangulated
//!   notch and its curves stop short. Curves reaching the boundary end
//!   there, open; the boundary itself is never part of the output.
