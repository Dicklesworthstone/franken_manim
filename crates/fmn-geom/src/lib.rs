//! Chisel: the geometry kernel — quadratic-Bézier paths, true arc length, booleans, SVG processing (§7).
//!
//! This crate owns the shared-anchor `QuadPath` model (§7.1) — the shared
//! vocabulary of Chisel, Marionette's point data, Scribe's glyph outlines,
//! and Lumen's compiled paths — plus the Bézier/smoothing layers under it.
//! Object-space geometry computes in f64 (§6.1). Semantics are ported from
//! the pinned Reference (`3b1b/manim` @ `6199a00d4c1b1127ebe45cb629c3f22538b10e13`)
//! and locked by the fixtures in `fixtures/` and `tests/`.
//!
//! [`space_ops`] is the Reference's vector/rotation vocabulary ported
//! signature for signature (§7.5), over [`rotation`], which fixes scipy
//! `Rotation`'s quaternion and Euler conventions as our documented
//! semantics — those conventions are stated normatively in
//! `docs/ROTATION_CONVENTIONS.md`, not inferred from this code.
//!
//! The one error-bounded cubic→quadratic converter is the ingress for API and
//! smoothing cubics (fm-6cf); TrueType quadratics pass through losslessly.
//! [`boolean`] is the permanent certified flatten-and-clip path boolean
//! (§7.4). [`isolines`] is the adaptive quadtree isoline extractor
//! `ImplicitFunction` rides (§7.7), and [`earclip`] the deterministic
//! hole-support triangulator for booleans' flatten fallback and mesh export
//! (§7.8, fm-81u). [`svg`] is the hardened user-SVG document processor
//! (§7.6, fm-6nm) with an explicit accept/reject matrix.
