//! Bounded, frame-index-ordered sink emission (§14.1, D-19).
//!
//! Dispatch reserves slots in sequence order before render work begins.
//! A reservation owns its [`FrameBuffer`] exclusively while a worker fills it;
//! publishing consumes that reservation, which is the visibility boundary that
//! makes torn frames impossible. Completion may happen in any order. A
//! dedicated drain thread exposes only the contiguous ready prefix to sinks.
//!
//! The ring owns exactly `capacity` preallocated frame buffers. It never grows
//! on the hot path. When every slot is outstanding, the next dispatch blocks
//! before receiving a buffer, so sink pressure propagates without letting later
//! frames occupy the slot needed by the drain's next sequence.
