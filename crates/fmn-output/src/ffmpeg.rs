//! The one external-tool boundary (§14.3, D2, D-23): sandboxed,
//! fingerprinted, optional ffmpeg.
//!
//! Everything here rides fmn-platform's process capability — an argv-only
//! interface (no caller-supplied shell command), cleared environment,
//! wall-clock timeout with kill, and capped log capture. This module adds the
//! boundary-level protocol on top:
//!
//! - **Resolution + executable binding.** The tool is canonicalized and
//!   content-hashed (SHA-256), then `-version` is run from a verified private
//!   copy—not from the configured pathname. Every later probe and job repeats
//!   that exact-create/copy/hash operation, rehashes the private executable
//!   after use, and records both paths, the hash, version, encoder, and full
//!   argv in [`Provenance`], together with the selected exact-image process
//!   mechanism and its policy version. Installations that cannot execute
//!   after relocation are rejected explicitly.
//! - **Optionality as a capability error.** An absent ffmpeg yields
//!   [`BoundaryError::FfmpegUnavailable`] naming the native
//!   alternatives — never a silent format substitution.
//! - **Owned private directories.** Resolution claims one canonical private
//!   session root, and each probe/job atomically claims a child directory
//!   (mode `0700` on Unix). Recorded filesystem identities gate both later
//!   creation and cleanup: a collision or replaced path is retained untouched.
//!   The job directory is the child's `TMPDIR`; every tool and artifact path is
//!   absolute, so the child inherits the engine's working directory and avoids
//!   widening the exact-image capability with a requested `cwd`. The artifact
//!   reaches the destination only through atomic rename after verification.
//! - **Environment allowlist + locale pinning.** The child sees
//!   exactly `LANG=C`, `LC_ALL=C`, and `TMPDIR=<job dir>`.
//! - **Hardware encoders enter here and only here.** They are named,
//!   validated against the probed encoder list, and recorded in
//!   provenance; ffmpeg products are excluded from certification by
//!   construction, so none of this touches the determinism story.
//!
//! The filesystem side (job dirs, rename publication) uses
//! `std::fs` directly: the boundary is a host-only feature by
//! definition — a platform without subprocesses has no ffmpeg boundary
//! and uses the native outputs instead.
//!
//! Safe `std` has no cross-platform execute-by-handle or
//! directory-handle-relative recursive deletion. Within the caller-supplied
//! trusted workdir ancestry, the private `0700` hierarchy, identity checks, and
//! hashes close ambient-path substitution. A hostile owner of that ancestry or
//! an actor already running as the same OS identity could still race a pathname
//! between the final check and the OS operation. That stronger threat requires
//! a future host capability rather than an unsafe platform carve-out.
