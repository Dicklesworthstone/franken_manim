//! Detached mobject values: plain data before any stage exists.
//!
//! The §15.1 boundary ratified by G0-1: mobjects are constructed and
//! composed as ordinary values (builders in higher crates convert via
//! `Into<Mobject>`), and `Stage::add` moves them — with their detached
//! children — into the arena.
//!
//! A detached mobject carries everything `Stage::add` needs to reconstruct
//! the entry: the record data, the per-object [`Uniforms`], and the
//! semantic [`ShapeTag`] its constructor built (§10.8). Those last two
//! matter because a builder decides them — `Dot` is a dot, `Circle` sets
//! its own stroke colour — and a value that could not carry them would
//! force every library class to be constructed in two halves, one before
//! `add` and one after.
