//! The render-order model (§8.5, §1.5, fm-jsc): what draws over what.
//!
//! Draw order is **meaning, not pixels** — a scene whose overlay lands under
//! its diagram is wrong no matter how beautifully it rasterizes — so the
//! Reference's actual ordering semantics are implemented here, engine-side,
//! and pinned by the ordering-trace corpus. Lumen consumes this as its
//! draw-order model (§10.1); painter's order for transparent content and
//! §10.8's per-tile command runs descend from it. The written spec,
//! including every citation into the pinned Reference, is
//! `docs/RENDER_ORDER.md`; it is normative for the W5 beads.
//!
//! **Two levels, one sequence.**
//!
//! 1. *The scene list.* Top-level scene members, ordered back to front. The
//!    Reference re-sorts on `add` by `(z_index, current position)` — a
//!    **stable** sort, so equal z_index keeps insertion order
//!    (`scene.py:338`). Adjacent members sharing `(class, shader id,
//!    z_index)` form one **render group** (`assemble_render_groups`,
//!    `scene.py:300`).
//! 2. *The families.* Each group draws its members' families in
//!    depth-first order, pointless members skipped, and adjacent members
//!    sharing a shader id draw as one batch (`get_shader_wrapper_list`,
//!    `mobject.py:2056`).
//!
//! A batch therefore never spans a render-group boundary — which is the one
//! consequence of the two-level shape that a flat "batch the flattened
//! list" model would get wrong, and the corpus pins it.
//!
//! **The batch key** is our [`BatchKey`]: the drawable program plus the
//! per-object uniform inventory. It stands in for the Reference's shader
//! id, whose hash is over exactly this material — program code, mobject
//! uniforms, `depth_test`, render primitive, textures
//! (`shader_wrapper.py:117`) — plus `stroke_behind`
//! (`shader_wrapper.py:354`). Float uniforms compare **bitwise**: two
//! objects whose `anti_alias_width` differs by an ulp are two batches,
//! exactly as two shader ids differ.
//!
//! **`depth_test` and `is_fixed_in_frame` partition, they do not reorder.**
//! Both live in the batch key, so depth-tested content can never share a
//! draw call with flat content and a frame-fixed overlay can never share
//! one with world content — but the *sequence* is still painter order over
//! the scene list. The depth test is a per-fragment operation inside that
//! sequence, not a re-sort of it (§10.4).
//!
//! **Two deliberate divergences (D5), both already ours:**
//!
//! - A mobject reachable twice inside one family (diamond composition) is
//!   drawn **once**: [`Stage::family`] deduplicates, where the Reference's
//!   `get_family` concatenates and would draw it twice — which double-
//!   composites transparent content. A mobject under two *separate scene
//!   roots* is still drawn once per root: that is two placements in the
//!   scene, not one.
//! - `z_index` on a *child* has no effect on order in either engine — the
//!   scene sort reads top-level members only — but here that is stated
//!   rather than discovered. `set_z_index(recurse = true)` still writes the
//!   whole family, because the value is per-object data and a child may be
//!   promoted to a root later.
