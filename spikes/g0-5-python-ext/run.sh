# G0-5 spike driver (fm-87q): build the prototype bridge, expose it as an
# importable module, run the extensibility suite and the crossing-cost
# bench. Repeatable: everything is pinned by this crate's own Cargo.lock
# and the workspace's rust-toolchain.toml.
#
# The build runs locally by design (RCH_CARGO_WRAPPER_BYPASS): the cdylib
# links the host CPython, which remote build workers do not carry.
