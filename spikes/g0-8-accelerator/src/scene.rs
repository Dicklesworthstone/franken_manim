//! The preview frame the spike renders.
//!
//! §20.1 spike 8's acceptance is "a Metal-rendered preview frame demonstrably
//! produced from the prototype IR", so the frame has to be worth rendering: a
//! flat test card would prove the plumbing and nothing about the mathematics.
//! This scene deliberately exercises every property the stroke stage owns:
//!
//! - **curvature** — arcs and a Lissajous figure, so the cubic root solve runs
//!   in its three-real-roots branch, not just the degenerate ones;
//! - **the `Line` primitive hint** — an axis grid of exactly-straight paths,
//!   which take the capsule fast path;
//! - **joins** — polylines with sharp interior angles, where the nearest
//!   segment changes across a pixel;
//! - **round caps** — every open end;
//! - **arc-length width tapers** — `set_stroke(width=[0, 6, 0])`-shaped
//!   profiles, whose interpolation is the reason segments carry arc-length
//!   spans at all;
//! - **overlapping transparency in painter order** — the property that makes
//!   per-tile command order load-bearing rather than incidental;
//! - **sub-pixel geometry** — a hairline thinner than the AA band, the regime
//!   where a wrong profile is most visible.
//!
//! Colours come from `fmn_core::constants`' palette, converted to linear light
//! once here, so the frame reads as a FrankenManim frame rather than as a
//! debug pattern.
