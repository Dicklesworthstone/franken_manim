"""One-time Reference imagery capture for the Look Gallery (fm-xb3, §16.3).

Renders the G0-2 calibration set with the pinned Reference engine
(3b1b/manim @ 6199a00d4c1b1127ebe45cb629c3f22538b10e13, at scripts/manim_ref)
and stores stills + a provenance manifest under gallery/reference_captures/
(gitignored — private fixtures per the §15.3 policy; the committed record is
docs/look_gallery/CAPTURE_INVENTORY.md).

THE CAPTURE DOCTRINE (D-16, §16.3): capture once, on one recorded
environment, and never maintain that environment again. There is no
certified Pango/llvmpipe stack to keep alive — the environment used is
*recorded* in PROVENANCE.json, and the captures are kept forever. The
Reference is imagery, never a pixel warden: these files feed the
human-judged Look Gallery and G0-2's calibration study (fm-k77), not any
bit-comparison gate.

Environment (only needed once, on the capture machine): the full Reference
import closure INCLUDING the GL stack — numpy scipy fonttools rich
mapbox_earcut pyyaml colour screeninfo appdirs tqdm validators addict
moderngl moderngl_window PyOpenGL pillow manimpango — plus a working OpenGL
context (a real GPU or EGL/OSMesa headless). Missing pieces fail with a
named capability error below, never a partial capture.

Usage:  python scripts/capture_reference_imagery.py [--out DIR]
        (supplement mode: PNGs already on disk are never re-captured or
         overwritten; PROVENANCE.json is merged, never replaced)

The recipe that worked (recorded for the record, NOT to be maintained — D-16):
a Mesa/llvmpipe software GL 4.5 core context under a virtual X server, which
needs no GPU at all. Both the Reference's pyglet shadow window and moderngl's
default context backend want a display, so Xvfb satisfies each in one step:

    python -m venv refenv
    refenv/bin/pip install -r scripts/manim_ref/requirements.txt
    xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1920x1080x24" \
