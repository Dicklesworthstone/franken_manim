# BN-23: First-error execution for native-backed mathematical plots

ParametricCurve, FunctionGraph and ImplicitFunction delegate geometry to Atlas
and Chisel. Their legacy construction bridges retained the first Python error
but continued executing authored functions during the rest of native sampling.
On small requests this meant six calls instead of one for a curve/graph, and
twenty-five for an implicit field whose first evaluation already raised.

## New construction boundary

The ordinary Python constructors and Mobject native-builder dispatch now share
the first-error guard also used by surface construction. An authored exception,
including cancellation via KeyboardInterrupt or SystemExit, or a result-conversion
exception stops all further authored callback execution in that construction.
The same exception object crosses the native bridge unchanged. A nested build
gets an independent guard. Successful functions retain their identity in graph
metadata and remain available for ordinary graph queries and live bindings.

Range and discontinuity iterables are bounded before eager Python materialization
or conversion to native vectors. A curve range consumes at most four entries to
admit the normal two/three-value forms, and an implicit domain at most three to
admit its two bounds. Discontinuities consume at most 65,537 entries before
rejecting requests over the existing 65,536-entry limit. Native aggregate sample,
partition, isoline depth and evaluation budgets remain authoritative.

A ParametricCurve callback returns exactly three finite real f32-representable
coordinates. FunctionGraph returns a finite real f32-representable scalar; explicit
discontinuities are the way to exclude its undefined locations. Numeric conversion
protocols remain supported for scalar samples, and their first errors are retained;
text and complex values are not silently coerced into real coordinates.

**Implicit-field non-finite values have a different meaning.** NaN and infinity
mark undefined regions to the native contourer and remain supported. Field values
are not point records, so they are not subjected to a surface/curve f32 restriction.
The native undefined-region subdivision, evaluation order and extracted geometry
are unchanged. A raised exception is still an error, not an undefined sample.

Successful native sample order, endpoint inclusion, smoothing and discontinuity
partitioning remain unchanged. In particular, Atlas's finite non-positive-step
endpoint-only policy is preserved; this adapter does not replace it with a
positive-step-only rule. The user function is never probed to guess its type,
vectorization capability, output dimensions or purity.

## Ownership and limits

Scene-bound objects cannot be reconstructed with __init__ or a construction seam;
use live binding or become. Rejected calls leave the existing scene owner, record
generation and exported views intact. Failed detached native builder calls do not
publish replacement geometry. Authored side effects made before failure are not
rolled back, nor is arbitrary unrelated host state transactionally restored.

This is the Python boundary, not a new fallible Rust sampling API. The native
loop can finish its already-bounded iterations after the first failure, receiving
sentinels without further authored calls. The native error channel then refuses
publication. Direct Rust callers and deliberate dispatch around Python Mobject
methods remain outside this adapter. Finite input validation is not a proof that
all extreme downstream smoothing/renderer arithmetic remains representable.

## Tests

`crates/fmn-python/tests/graph_admission.py` uses the actual compiled native module.
It covers first/middle-sample failures, cancellation, conversion protocols,
implicit undefined regions, bounded generators, native budget precedence,
discontinuities, endpoint policies, ownership, independent nested construction,
callable lifetime and idempotent installation. Successful points and animated Y4M
are compared with the original native builders at one and four threads.
