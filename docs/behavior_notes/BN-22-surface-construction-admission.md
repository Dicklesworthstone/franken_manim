# BN-22: Bounded surface construction and first-error callback execution

## Problem and scope

The Python surface bridge delegates sampling and normals to Atlas. Its former
infallible native sampling loop stored the first Python error but kept invoking
the callback: a 2-by-2 surface could run a failing user function twelve times.
Native stock surface constructors also accepted sizes without an authoring budget.
The existing plotting-only guard did not cover Surface subclasses, stock solids,
or direct calls to the normal Python object's native construction methods.

The production portal now admits those calls through one surface-construction
adapter. It does not implement another geometry sampler or change the native
sample ordering, normal calculation, storage, or renderer.

## Behavior

* A construction may invoke authored code only through its first failed sample.
  The original exception, including KeyboardInterrupt or SystemExit, propagates.
  Result conversion errors receive the same treatment. Each construction has its
  own guard; a nested failed construction does not poison an outer one.
* UV functions return exactly three finite real, f32-representable coordinates.
  Extra components, non-real arrays, NaN, infinity and out-of-record-range samples
  are refused rather than truncated or stored as invalid native points.
* Grid axes are nonnegative integer indices. Floating-point dimensions are not
  silently truncated. Each axis and the total grid are bounded by 65,536. The
  per-axis bound also protects empty grids such as `(0, very_large)`.
* Cube construction charges all six sampled faces against the same aggregate
  point budget. Ordinary small cube/prism defaults are unchanged.
* UV ranges and derivative controls must be finite. Epsilon must be positive,
  normal nudge nonnegative, and preferred creation axis either zero or one.
  Reversed and collapsed finite ranges, empty grids and one-point-wide strips
  keep their existing construction behavior.
* A scene-bound object cannot be reconstructed with `__init__` or a construction
  method. Use `init_points()` for supported live regeneration, or `become()` for
  replacement. Rejected calls do not reset the object's scene mirror or invoke
  the UV function. A failed detached native build does not replace its geometry.

Successful constructor signatures and authored function identities are retained.
The adapter is installed by the one production initializer, before plotting uses
its shared admission rules. Saved native methods are resolved from the native
namespace rather than held in class-method closures, following the portal's
module-lifetime protocol.

## Native fallible sampling

`SurfaceSpec::try_sample` and `try_sample_with_budget` now perform admission and
sampling in Rust, returning `SurfaceSampleError<E>`. The callback may borrow its
environment and mutate local state; its error does not need `Clone`, `Send`, or a
`'static` lifetime. An error from a position or either derivative probe returns
immediately. No later probe, remaining grid iteration, or triangle generation
runs, and no partially sampled surface is returned. Successful sample ordering
and normal arithmetic remain unchanged.

Both dimensions, their checked product, all record columns, and triangle storage
are admitted before authored sampling. Every output allocation for the sampled
surface is reserved before the first callback. Samples and derived normal-control
points must be finite and f32-representable. Existing empty/strip behavior remains.
The explicit budget belongs to the native caller; the Python raw bridge uses the
default budget. The existing infallible `sample` entry delegates to this owner and
panics on a violated construction contract; untrusted native inputs should use
the fallible API.

The raw PyO3 parametric-surface method now calls the fallible native API, including
when deliberately invoked around the host admission adapter. It preserves the
original Python exception and extracts exactly three coordinates without
materializing an unbounded result vector. Scene-bound construction is refused
before sampling. The host adapter remains responsible for Python input conversion
and aggregate multi-face solid admission; it is not a second native sampler.

## Explicit limitations

The native fallible API applies to rectangular UV sampling, not every specialized
solid's post-sampling transformation or compound allocation. In particular, a
direct Rust cube/prism builder still does not expose a fallible aggregate
six-face budget. Python aggregate admission and native single-grid admission are
distinct contracts. The renderer's arithmetic domain is unchanged; finite inputs
alone do not prove that all later transforms remain representable. A callback
that does not return cannot be preempted by this synchronous error channel.

Authored side effects before a callback failure are not rolled back. Existing
empty/strip-grid restrictions in UV queries and morph alignment are unchanged.

## Regression evidence

`crates/fmn-python/tests/surface_admission.py` exercises real native construction,
stock-solid budgets, exception identity, probe ordering, owner preservation,
reentrancy, live regeneration, and successful record/pixel equivalence with the
unguarded native sampler on safe inputs. The surface workflow and installed-wheel
gate execute this suite. No giant unchecked allocation is used as a negative
control.

`crates/fmn-library/tests/surface_sampling.rs` verifies the native owner directly.
`crates/fmn-python/tests/native_surface_sampling.py` bypasses the host callback
guard and tests the raw bridge's admission, each derivative-probe failure,
original exception identity, and unchanged target records/views after refusal.
