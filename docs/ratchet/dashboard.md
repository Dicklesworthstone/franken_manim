# The fmd-math coverage ratchet

The headline metric of the no-LaTeX pivot (§11.5): what fraction of the
real 3b1b formula corpus typesets natively. The denominator is **frozen**
(G0-4: `9269` distinct strings, `17711` occurrences, corpus hash
`a8325e49e0ce78fcc735533952740e9adeaaa5cb10f9c13d73aaa3ba4bf883fc`, rules_version 1); the numbers may only rise.

**Computed against franken_markdown `e4e8e2ee1b8e`.**

| Plane | Occurrence-weighted | Unique-string |
|---|---|---|
| **Parse** | 99.994 % | 99.989 % |
| **Parse + typeset returned Ok** | 99.994 % | 99.989 % |
| **Layout within 5% of real TeX (oracle)** | 24.476 % | 2.514 % |

"Typeset returned Ok" means fmd-math produced a layout without an error. It does not show that the layout is right. The corpus TeX box oracle (fm-tex-layout-oracle-bkbc) lays out 585 strings, sampled by construct class and occurrence (6847 occurrences), and compares each box with real TeX's: 233 are within 5% and 365 within 10%, covering 4335 occurrences within 5%. The oracle row counts only those verified strings against the whole corpus; unsampled strings count as unverified.

## How this is enforced

- Coverage is a pure function of (frozen corpus, fmd-math pin), so the
numbers can only move when `SUITE.lock`'s `franken_markdown` row moves.
An always-on CI test requires `baseline.tsv` to name the current pin:
**a pin bump without a ratchet re-run fails CI.**
- On corpus-bearing machines the ratchet test recomputes all four
counts and fails on any decrease; `RATCHET_UPDATE=1` blesses a
deliberate advance (with this dashboard regenerated in the same
commit).
- Every non-tier-1 construct must fail with its precise, named,
tier-tagged error — audited construct-by-construct against the G0-4
table in always-on CI. Nothing ever fails silently.

## The escalation path (R1, the G2 checkpoint)

If coverage misses a gate's criteria, the response is a **public
amendment with a construct-sprint plan** — never a silent slip: the
gap is named construct-by-construct above, each with its tracked
bead, and the gate review adjudicates the sprint scope in the open.

## Licensing (§15.3)

The corpus strings are 3b1b-authored course material and stay in the
private fixture; this dashboard publishes **numbers, construct names,
and hashes only**. Anyone with the pinned trees can reproduce the
denominator byte-for-byte via `scripts/harvest_tex_corpus.py`.
