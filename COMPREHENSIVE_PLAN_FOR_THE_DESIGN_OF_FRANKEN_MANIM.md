# COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR THE DESIGN OF FRANKENMANIM

**Working name:** FrankenManim (`franken_manim`, crate prefix `fmn-`)
**Language:** Rust, edition 2024, on an exact pinned nightly toolchain recorded in `SUITE.lock` (no "or later")
**Safety target:** no project-authored `unsafe` anywhere outside the explicitly isolated binding crate (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in every authoritative fmn crate); the full transitive dependency closure is pinned, allowlisted, and audited for `unsafe` and native-code exposure
**Dependency target:** `std` plus the Dicklesworthstone-owned FrankenSuite — `franken_numpy`, `frankenscipy`, `franken_networkx`, `frankenpandas`, `franken_markdown` (which this program extends with a native math-typesetting engine), `frankentorch`, `asupersync` — under the governed-closure doctrine of §3
**External tools policy:** **`ffmpeg` is the single permitted external tool**, invoked as a sandboxed subprocess for video encode/mux and for transcoding media formats outside the native codec set — because owning a modern video encoder is genuinely impractical, and nothing else is. **There is no LaTeX, no dvisvgm, no Pango, no fontconfig, no system-font requirement on any path, ever.** Typesetting — text and TeX-style mathematics — is native, built on bundled fonts and a new math-layout engine that lands as workspace crates in franken_markdown (§11). Native y4m/PNG-sequence/GIF outputs exist so even ffmpeg is optional for core operation
**Compatibility contract:** FrankenManim is **API- and semantics-compatible** with manim — the class surface, the scene model, the animation semantics — and **deliberately not output-identical** to it. The goals, in order: the result must be *correct* (true mathematics under the familiar names) and must *look good* (a renderer and typesetter built to a quality bar, judged as such). Pixel-, RNG-, and clock-level equivalence with the Python implementation are explicit non-goals (§4)
**System class:** deterministic, programmatic mathematical-animation engine: 2D/3D vector graphics compiler, quadratic-Bézier geometry kernel, native typesetting system, scene runtime, CPU-first vector rasterizer with one semantic renderer over multiple execution engines (certified CPU, fast CPU, and a standard-only Accelerator Annex), and video/image output pipeline — usable as a Rust library, a CLI, a live studio, and a Python `manimlib`-compatible module scoped by §15
**Reference:** `3b1b/manim` @ `6199a00d4c1b1127ebe45cb629c3f22538b10e13` (master, 2026-07-17) — pinned as **the Reference**: the immutable source of the API surface, the semantic model, structural test fixtures, and the aesthetic bar. It is a design oracle, not a pixel oracle
**Document date:** 2026-07-19
**Document status:** bold greenfield architecture and execution program; intentionally not an MVP specification. **Revision 3** (same date): a deliberate contract pivot after Revisions 1–2. Rev 2's adversarial audit corrected every factual error about the Reference and exposed the three-way contradiction between exact conformance, cross-platform reproducibility, and improved mathematics. Rev 3 resolves it by decision rather than machinery: **conformance-to-pixels is dropped as a goal.** What remains is the stronger pair — correctness and beauty — plus a hard sovereignty rule (one external tool), which together delete roughly a third of Rev 2's compatibility apparatus while raising the bar on what the engine itself must be. **Revision 4** (same date): the performance-architecture revision, synthesizing two independent external design reviews (GPT-5.6; Kimi K3). Rev 3's determinism doctrine had already built nearly every seam a high-performance engine needs — write-disjoint tiles, fixed composite order, thread-count-independent output, CoW snapshots, the SoA escape hatch, the annex concept, and an ffmpeg boundary that excludes encoded video from certification — but §17 treated parallelism and SIMD as a *posture* ("scalar-first, spike-gated") rather than a designed system. Rev 4 designs the system under one organizing principle: **semantics and bits stay pinned; the scheduler gets freedom.** Every new lever is either bit-exact by construction (safe even in `certified`) or explicitly quarantined to `standard` and labeled. Nothing in the contract, the look, the sovereignty rule, or Rev 3's semantic decisions changes; what changes is that the renderer becomes retained (§10.8), frames become immutable and pipelined (§9.3, §9.5, §17.4), anti-aliasing becomes adaptive (§10.4), SIMD becomes a named mechanism (§17.3), the annex becomes plural and early (§10.7), and the output boundary becomes negotiated (§14.3)

## 0. Declaration of intent

FrankenManim should not be designed as "manim with Rust syntax," "cairo bindings with a scene loop," or a thin wrapper over an existing graphics stack. Those paths would produce competent software and miss the opportunity.

The opportunity: manim — Grant Sanderson's engine behind 3Blue1Brown — is ~23,000 lines of Python whose *ideas* are superb and whose *substrate* is an accident of history: roughly thirty third-party packages, an OpenGL driver stack, a C Pango build, a Skia build, **a LaTeX distribution**, and CPython. The LaTeX dependency alone means no clean install, no WASM, no server deployment without a container full of native software, and no reproducibility. The FrankenSuite has already rebuilt the scientific substrate (arrays, ODEs, assignment, graphs, tables, tensors) in clean-room Rust with zero project-authored `unsafe` — and franken_markdown already holds a zero-dependency typography stack with **Computer Modern itself** bundled. The missing piece is not fonts; it is a math-layout engine. Building one is this program's central act of ambition, and it lands where it multiplies: inside franken_markdown, where it also gives every fmd document native mathematics.

The design commitments:

1. **API compatibility and semantic fidelity — not output conformance.** FrankenManim implements manim's surface: its classes, constructors, method names, scene lifecycle, animation composition, updater model, and coordinate conventions, so that manim knowledge and manim scene code transfer directly. Under those familiar names it does **the correct thing**: `MoveAlongPath` moves at true constant speed, `get_arc_length` returns the arc length, colors composite in a defined color model, the clock does not drift. The Reference defines *what things mean*; our mathematics defines *what they equal*. Every intentional semantic difference is documented in the user-facing **Behavior Notes** (§16.8) — a migration guide, not a conformance ledger.
2. **No MVP.** Every subsystem is specified at full strength. Sequencing is by dependency, not scope reduction; the gates in §20 are integration checkpoints, and G0 exists so no later gate begins with its contracts unresolved.
3. **Sovereignty: one external tool.** ffmpeg, for encode/mux/transcode, sandboxed and optional (native y4m/PNG/GIF paths exist). Everything else — typesetting included, *especially* typesetting — is native, inside the governed closure of §3. This is the moat: an animation studio that installs as one binary and renders identically on a laptop, a bare server, and (in tiers) a browser.
4. **Determinism as a product feature — now stronger.** With LaTeX and Pango gone from every path, the entire pipeline up to the encode boundary is closed: same content-hashed input closure ⇒ bit-identical raw frames and canonical PNGs across the certified matrix (§16.7), on the owned deterministic math layer (§6.6). Encoded video is equivalence-classed, never bit-promised.
5. **Two front doors, one engine.** A first-class Rust API proven by a compiling prototype, and `fmn-python`: a PyO3 module presenting the `manimlib` surface with normal Python subclassing semantics — source-compatible, rendering scenes *correctly and beautifully*, with no claim of pixel-reproducing the originals (§15).
6. **Contracts before construction.** Gate G0 (§20.1) retires the load-bearing unknowns — object-model lifetime, renderer look-calibration, math-engine architecture, Python extensibility, cross-platform float behavior, dependency closure, accelerator viability — as compile-tested spikes before W2–W11 freeze interfaces.
7. **One semantics, many engines; pinned bits, free scheduler.** Lumen is one renderer *semantically* — one draw-order model, one definition of clipping/strokes/fills/color/camera, one compiled render IR, one correctness corpus, explicitly stated tolerances — executed by multiple engines (certified CPU, fast CPU, and the standard-only Accelerator Annex) that share the IR and the tests, never a lowest-common-denominator kernel (§10.1). Wherever bits are promised (certified outputs, self-goldens), every schedule must reproduce them exactly; everywhere else the scheduler is free. Performance is architecture (§10.8, §17), not a late pass of micro-optimization.

## 1. Anatomy of the Reference: what manim actually is

The pinned commit is 90 Python files, ~23,100 lines, **257 classes**, 28 GLSL shaders, two YAML configs. Every claim below was verified against source during the Rev-2 audit. Rev 3 reads this section differently than Rev 2 did: it is the **semantic specification and design reference** — the things users' mental models and scene code depend on — plus an honest record of mechanisms and quirks we deliberately do *not* copy (marked ↷, with the replacement noted).

### 1.1 The data plane

Every mobject's geometry and style live in one typed record buffer: `Mobject.data` is a NumPy structured array — an **array of interleaved records** with typed field views, not a struct-of-arrays — whose dtype doubles as the vertex layout:

```python
# Mobject:  [('point', f32, (3,)), ('rgba', f32, (4,))]
# VMobject: [('point', f32, (3,)), ('stroke_rgba', f32, (4,)), ('stroke_width', f32, (1,)),
#            ('joint_angle', f32, (1,)), ('fill_rgba', f32, (4,)), ('base_normal', f32, (3,)),
#            ('fill_border_width', f32, (1,))]   # Surface/DotCloud/Image declare their own;
#                                                # user subclasses may declare custom dtypes.
```

`self.data["point"]` yields live strided views users read and mutate directly; `get_points()` returns a live view. This record-buffer model, the `uniforms` block (including four clip-plane slots), `submobjects`/`parents`/cached `family`, bounding boxes with dirty flags, and Python's open instance `__dict__` are all **API surface** — §8 preserves them exactly, because scene code touches them.

### 1.2 The geometry plane

`VMobject` paths are joined quadratic Béziers over a **shared-anchor layout**: `points = [a0, h0, a1, h1, a2, …]`, length odd when nonempty, curve *i* = `points[2i..2i+3]`, subpath break = a null curve whose anchor equals its handle. This invariant is API surface (curve counts, partial reveals, alignment, user code indexing points) and Chisel preserves it exactly (§7.1). Cubics are accepted and reduced to quadratics — the Reference uses a crude two-quad splitter plus fontTools `cu2qu` in smooth mode ↷ *we use one error-bounded converter everywhere* (§7.2). The proportion/length layer is chord-distance heuristics (three mutually inconsistent approximations; `quick_point_from_proportion` assumes equal curve lengths) ↷ *true arclength under the original names* (§7.3). Anchor modes (`jagged`/`approx_smooth`/`true_smooth`), the smoothing solvers (banded open / dense closed), arc primitives (three arc-density conventions live in the Reference), subdivision, per-vertex joint angles, and space_ops — whose quaternion/Euler conventions follow scipy `Rotation` and are *kept* as the convention users' camera code assumes (§7.5) — complete the plane.

### 1.3 The animation plane

`Animation`: `(mobject, run_time=1.0, time_span, lag_ratio, rate_func=smooth, remover, final_alpha_value, suspend_mobject_updating)`, lifecycle `begin → interpolate(alpha) → finish`, per-submobject lag via `get_sub_alpha`. **80 animation classes across 13 modules** reduce to five mechanisms: Transform-family (family alignment + field lerp through `path_func`), partial-reveal, fade/grow, indication composites, and functional maps (Homotopy/PhaseFlow/MoveAlongPath). Composition: `AnimationGroup`/`Succession`/`LaggedStart(Map)` over `(start, end)` intervals; the `.animate` builder records chained calls into a target (arguments set once per chain; `override_animate` methods un-chainable; dynamic target lookup). `prepare_animation` accepts `Animation | _AnimationBuilder` only. Updaters run dt and non-dt in insertion order; `ValueTracker`s and `always_redraw`-closures bind recomputation into the clock. All of this is semantics we implement exactly (§8–§9). Seeded randomness in the Reference is two streams (CPython `random` + NumPy legacy `RandomState`) ↷ *one stream, PCG64DXSM, already bit-exact in fnp* (§6.5).

### 1.4 The runtime plane

`Scene.play`: `prepare → pre_play → begin → progress → finish → post_play`; per frame, the load-bearing order is **animation `update_mobjects(dt)` → animation `interpolate(alpha)` → time advances → scene updaters (observing post-interpolation state) → capture → emit** — kept exactly, because `always_redraw` scenes depend on it (§9.3). Frame sampling follows `arange(0, run_time, 1/fps) + 1/fps` (no emitted alpha-zero frame; `begin()` interpolates at zero separately; final sample may exceed `run_time`) — the *sample points* are kept, computed on a rational clock so nothing drifts ↷ (§9.2). `SceneState` snapshots (time, play count, top-level mobjects + copies), `InteractiveScene`, the IPython embed/`checkpoint_paste` workflow, autoreload, the event dispatcher, presenter mode, `show()`, and the windowed fps=30 override complete the plane.

### 1.5 The render plane (reference, not template)

The Reference's GPU pipeline is a set of ingenious workarounds we record and then decline to copy: winding-number fill via signed-alpha triangle blending (`a→−0.95a/(1−0.95a)`, Loop–Blinn `y−x²` edge test, a 2×-resolution f16 fill canvas, a ×1.06 composite un-mangle, GL_MAX-composited fill borders) and strokes as **adaptive polyline ribbons** (≤ 32 segments, cross-strip smoothstep, parameter-space width interpolation, butt caps). ↷ Lumen rasterizes the mathematics directly: analytic winding coverage, true curve-distance strokes with round caps and principled joins, linear-light compositing (§10). What we *keep* from this plane is the **look**: the `finalize_color` lighting model (`shading = (reflectiveness, gloss, shadow)`, light at (−10, 10, 10)), the camera projection constants (`w = 1−z`, `z *= −0.1`, frame rescale, `is_fixed_in_frame` as a float mix), clip planes, glow-dot falloff, the AA weight (~1.5 px feel), stroke-width conversion (0.01), and the default palette — the aesthetic DNA, adopted deliberately and calibrated in G0's look study. The Reference also exposes arbitrary GLSL injection (`set_color_by_code`, custom `shader_folder`s) used by real corpus scenes — scoped honestly in §15.4.

### 1.6 The library plane: the 257-class census

Verified class-by-class (full table, Appendix A): core object types 25 · geometry & shapes 39 · coordinate systems & plotting 30 · 3D solids 15 · text & typesetting 40 · animations 80 · interaction 12 · runtime 16. The census is necessary, not sufficient: `from manimlib import *` also exports the utility-function surface through wildcard imports with no authoritative `__all__` — the Parity Ledger enumerates *symbols* (§16.1).

### 1.7 The dependency displacement map

| Reference dependency | Call sites | FrankenManim displacement |
|---|---|---|
| numpy | everywhere | **franken_numpy** (fnp-ndarray/ufunc/linalg; fnp-io `.npy` for fixtures) |
| CPython `random` + numpy legacy RandomState | seeding, noise, shuffles | ↷ **one PCG64DXSM stream** (fnp-random, bit-exact), snapshot/restorable (§6.5) |
| scipy | `linear_sum_assignment` + `cdist` (string matching); `Rotation` (space_ops/camera); `solve_ivp` (StreamLines); banded + dense solves (smoothing) | **frankenscipy** fsci-opt/-spatial/-integrate/-linalg; Rotation *conventions* kept as API semantics; solver quality ours (§7.5, §12.4) |
| fontTools (`cu2qu` in the kernel; TTF elsewhere) | smoothing; fonts | ↷ one error-bounded converter in **Chisel**; **fmd-font** for all font parsing (§7.2, §11.2) |
| moderngl / PyOpenGL / pyglet / moderngl_window / screeninfo | render + window | **Lumen** native renderer (§10) + **Studio** (§13) |
| manimpango (Pango; default font Consolas) | Text/MarkupText | ↷ **Scribe** native shaping/layout on bundled fonts; bundled default face (§11.1, §11.3) |
| **latex/xelatex + dvisvgm** | Tex/TexText and Tex-backed classes | ↷ **eliminated. `fmd-math` — the native math-typesetting engine in franken_markdown — is the only math path** (§11.4–11.5); incidental Tex-backed classes are de-TeX'd into native constructions (§12.3) |
| svgelements | SVGMobject | **fmn-geom** SVG document processor with security limits (§7.6) — for *user* SVGs; no dvisvgm quirks to replicate |
| skia-pathops | boolean ops | **Chisel** path booleans, flatten-fallback first (§7.4) |
| mapbox-earcut / isosurfaces | triangulation; ImplicitFunction | **Chisel** ear-clip utility; owned adaptive isolines honoring the `min_depth`/`max_quads` knobs (§7.7–7.8) |
| Pillow / pydub | images; sound | **fmn-codec** PNG (full color-type matrix) + JPEG decode; WAV/PCM mixer; **ffmpeg transcodes anything else** (§14) |
| pygments / matplotlib / rich / tqdm / diskcache / appdirs / yaml / addict | highlighting; colormaps; UX; cache; config | **fmd** highlighter; owned colormaps; fmn-cli; **fmn-cache**; **fmn-config** specified to the actual files |
| trimesh / pywavefront | ThreeDModel | **fmn-library** OBJ-subset reader |
| URL asset fetching | file lookup | `AssetFetcher` capability trait (host-provided); no TLS in core |
| ffmpeg (binary) | encode | **retained — the one external tool**: encode, mux, and media transcode, sandboxed per §3 D2 |

`sympy` is declared upstream and imported nowhere — a phantom, carried in no obligation.

## 2. Foundation audit: the FrankenSuite substrate

Audited at the Rust-native symbol level (Rule D6) with the whole suite commit-pinned (§2.8).

**2.1 franken_numpy — load-bearing.** `fnp-{dtype, ndarray, iter, ufunc, linalg, random, io, conformance, runtime, python}` around the `NdLayout` stride engine; zero project-authored `unsafe`. Synergies: fnp-dtype *is* a structured-record engine, so §8.2's `RecordBuffer` is its native representation; fnp-io `.npy` is the fixture interchange; fnp-linalg serves space_ops. **RNG:** with output parity dropped, the Reference's two legacy MT19937 streams are irrelevant — FrankenManim standardizes on fnp-random's **PCG64DXSM, already bit-exact against NumPy for explicit seeds**, as the single seeded stream everywhere (§6.5). One RNG, snapshot/restorable, deterministic: strictly better and already built.

**2.2 frankenscipy — surgical, fixture-driven.** fsci-opt `linear_sum_assignment` and fsci-spatial `cdist` (both confirmed in-tree) power string matching; fsci-integrate's RK/Radau/BDF power StreamLines — the obligation is now *a good adaptive RK45 with dense output*, ours to tune, not solve_ivp emulation; fsci-linalg covers both smoothing solves. A Rotation-conventions module (fmn-core or upstreamed) fixes quaternion sign, composition order, and `as_euler("zxz")` behavior to the scipy conventions users' camera code assumes — kept as *semantics*, tested at singularities.

**2.3 franken_markdown — from sleeping giant to second home.** fmd already holds the typography stack: the `text::Font` sfnt parser (cmap 4/12, glyf/loca, composites, hmtx, kern + focused GPOS, subsetting), a layout engine, a vector PDF writer, a shared syntax highlighter, SVG handling, WASM as a first-class target — and bundled OFL faces including **Computer Modern** (roman/bold/italic/bold-italic + CM Typewriter) and a curated **Noto Sans Math** fallback. Rev 3 makes fmd the *home of the program's boldest deliverable*: the repo grows a small workspace of new crates — **`fmd-font`** (the Font module factored out and extended with the glyf **outline decoder**: simple + composite glyphs → quadratic contours with phantom-point-correct metrics) and **`fmd-math`** (the native TeX-math layout engine of §11.4) — so fmd documents gain native `$…$` mathematics in HTML and PDF, and FrankenManim consumes both crates through the suite. The highlighter displaces pygments verbatim; the asupersync-behind-a-feature posture is adopted unchanged. Honestly tiered gaps remain (GSUB ligatures, mark positioning, fallback chains, CFF/CFF2, variable fonts, bidi/complex scripts — §11.1, §16.6): the suite shortens the road; it does not finish it.

**2.4 franken_networkx / 2.5 frankenpandas — leapfrog fuel.** As before: fnx-backed Graph mobjects (layout kernels audited or upstreamed, with explicit determinism rules) and fp-backed data mobjects; fp-frankentui is the TUI precedent. Enhanced-tier content, never blocking core gates (§12.5–12.6).

**2.6 frankentorch — the accelerator gateway, spike-gated.** Content role (`NeuralNetworkMobject` on real ft-nn modules); acceleration role — **the Accelerator Annex's only route to GPUs** (§10.7): Metal kernels today, CUDA via ft as an upstream-ledger spike (§2.9), admitted only after the proof spike now scheduled in G0, excluded from certified renders and from the core gates, and measured under its own PG-A profiles (§17.5); research role (differentiable animation: autograd is a foundation, the differentiable-renderer surrogate is its own exploratory program). No other GPU dependency is contemplated — wgpu-class crates are a D1 audit catastrophe and would duplicate ft.

**2.7 asupersync — opt-in.** The `batch` feature for multi-scene farms with structured cancellation and budgets; the deterministic lab for scheduler tests. Never in the frame loop.

**2.8 SUITE.lock.** Exact commits/checksums for every foundation repo (fmd's new crates included), asupersync, the rustc nightly, and certified target-feature sets. CI builds only from the lock; upgrades are deliberate and Gauntlet-diffed.

**2.9 The upstream contributions ledger.** Primitives that belong in a foundation crate land there, tracked in `UPSTREAM_LEDGER.md`. Seed entries: **fmd-font factoring + outline decoder**; **fmd-math itself** (the largest upstream contribution in suite history); fmd CFF outlines (tiered); fnx layout kernels (audit first); fsci Rotation-conventions exposure; fnp structured-record lerp fast path; **ft CUDA device path** (the annex's second backend — spiked on the ledger before any production claim).

---

## 3. The dependency & safety doctrine

**Rule D1 — the governed closure.** Authoritative fmn crates introduce **no new unreviewed direct runtime dependencies**. The complete transitive closure — the suite's own dependencies, FFI crates, proc-macros, build scripts, platform crates — is pinned and governed by an explicit per-package allowlist (name/version/source/checksum, features, license, build-script and proc-macro status, native-link status, build-time network, unsafe-audit status, reason, owner, upgrade policy), with runtime / FFI / platform-WASM / build / dev / fuzz tracked under separate policies. The audit is an owned `fmn-conformance` check; CI fails on any unlisted package. Pre-authorized beyond the suite: PyO3 (fmn-python only), clap (`cli`), wasm-bindgen (`wasm`).

**Rule D2 — one external tool.** **ffmpeg** is the only subprocess the engine will ever invoke: encode, mux, and transcode of media outside the native codec set — under the full security protocol (argv-only invocation, per-job private temp dirs, timeouts + process-tree cancellation, output-size limits, environment allowlist + locale pinning, atomic result publication, executable path *and content hash* into provenance). It is optional: native y4m, PNG-sequence, and GIF outputs exist, and its absence yields a **capability error** naming the alternative — never a silent format substitution. There is no second tool and no carve-out for one: no TeX, no font tooling, no downloader (network exists only behind the host-provided `AssetFetcher` trait; no TLS in the core). `--reproducible` renders exclude even ffmpeg from the certified artifact set (raw frames + canonical PNG + WAV are the certified outputs; encoded video is downstream convenience).

**Rule D3 — the unsafe posture.** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in every authoritative crate: no project-authored unsafe outside fmn-python (PyO3 expansion; the fnp precedent). A claim about our code; the closure is covered by D1's per-package audit.

**Rule D4 — explicitly not built here.** Arrays/dtypes/RNG/`.npy` — fnp. ODE/quadrature/interpolation/special/assignment/distance/solves — fsci. Graphs — fnx. Dataframes — fp. Markdown, font parsing, **math typesetting (fmd-math)**, highlighting, PDF — fmd. Tensors/autograd/Metal — ft. Structured concurrency — asupersync. Video encoding — ffmpeg. FrankenManim's owned surface: the geometry kernel, the mobject engine, the animation engine, the scene runtime, the rasterizer, the text-layout layer over fmd-font, the manim-facing typesetting integration, the codecs/cache/platform substrate, and the output pipeline.

**Rule D5 — correct by default, documented when different.** Where FrankenManim's behavior differs semantically from the Reference — true arclength, one RNG, the rational clock, color science, fixed Reference bugs — the difference is deliberate, correct, and recorded in the Behavior Notes (§16.8) with migration guidance. There is no quirk-replication obligation anywhere in the program.

**Rule D6 — symbol-level binding proof.** Every dependency-map row names the exact Rust symbol bound, links a fixture, and states its determinism class. Headline conformance percentages are never accepted as evidence.

---

## 4. The product contract: one semantics, two determinism levels

Rev 2 needed three semantic presets because it was carrying pixel conformance. Rev 3 needs one semantics — **correct and beautiful** — with orthogonal knobs:

**Semantics (single).** True mathematics under manim's names; the §1.5 look constants; native typesetting; linear-light-correct compositing with manim's gradient aesthetic preserved (§6.3); the rational clock on manim's sample points; one seeded RNG. Behavior Notes document every point where this diverges from the Python implementation.

**Determinism axis.** `standard` (default): deterministic given a seed on a given build/platform; best-effort across platforms. `certified` (`--reproducible`): the complete content-hashed input closure of §16.7 — bundled fonts only, no `AssetFetcher`, fmn-dmath transcendentals, canonical raster arithmetic — yielding bit-identical raw frames, canonical PNGs, and WAV across the certified matrix, with a sidecar manifest. ffmpeg products are excluded from certification by construction.

**Quality/backend knobs, never semantics.** Adaptive-AA policy and edge-supersampling factor (§10.4), preview resolution and dirty-region/retained-compositor policy, thread count and the derived execution plan (§17.4), the **execution engine** — `cpu` (the default: certified arithmetic under `--reproducible`, fast mixed-precision otherwise) or the standard-only annex engines `metal`/`cuda` (§10.7) — hardware video encoders through the ffmpeg boundary (§14.3), WASM tiers. Engine and scheduler selection changes speed, never scene semantics; `interactive` remains an execution/UI mode.

**Compatibility posture.** Source-level: manim scene code and manim knowledge transfer. Structural: constructors produce the same shapes, counts, and layouts (loose-tolerance fixtures against the Reference where formulas intentionally coincide). Visual: judged by the Look Gallery (§16.3) as *at least as good*, never as identical. This is the whole contract; there is no oracle-pixel preset to maintain, and the engineering it required — the shader-faithful backend, dual legacy RNGs, the float-drift clock, the certified Pango/llvmpipe capture environment — is deleted, not deferred.

## 6. Substrate (fmn-core, fmn-dmath, fmn-hash, fmn-config, fmn-platform)

**6.1 Numeric doctrine — mixed precision by design.** Semantic geometry computes in **f64** end-to-end: object-space construction, the geometry APIs, and render-plan compilation. `RecordBuffer` fields store **f32 matching the Reference dtypes** — not for pixel parity, but because (a) the dtype is API surface for `mobject.data` and zero-copy NumPy views, and (b) f32 records halve memory traffic in the hot loop. Below the compilation boundary the doctrine tiers deliberately (Rev 4): **standard** screen-space segments, coefficients, color, and blending run in f32 with FMA permitted, and a screen-space conversion is accepted only when its computed error is under an explicit subpixel budget (initial target ≈ 1/256 px) — otherwise the compiler subdivides the curve or routes it to the high-precision fallback; **certified** screen-space representation is the canonical raster arithmetic of §10.5 (fixed-point coordinates and integer coverage, pending G0-6's ratification), with fixed-order reductions, FMA off, and fmn-dmath transcendentals. Degenerate and badly-conditioned cases — near-vertical tangents, ambiguous roots — route to the precision-exception path in every mode. NaN/−0 canonicalization at serialization boundaries.

**6.2 Constants & units.** FRAME_HEIGHT = 8 and the coordinate conventions, direction constants, buffs, `DEG`/`TAU`, default stroke widths and the manim palette, `STROKE_WIDTH_CONVERSION = 0.01`, the resolution table and 30 fps default — kept, because they are the shared language of every manim scene, locked by a constants test against the Reference module.

**6.3 Color.** One pipeline, ours: colors decode to linear light, composite premultiplied, encode at the output transfer — with **manim's gradient aesthetic deliberately preserved**: `interpolate_color` keeps the Reference's √(lerp(c₁², c₂², α)) form (it was chosen to look good, and it does) and `average_color` its RMS form, applied in the defined model. Full named palette, `color_gradient`, owned colormap tables, fmd's `hwb()`/`color-mix()` machinery; an Oklab interpolation option for the adventurous. Documented once in the Behavior Notes as "correct compositing, familiar gradients."

**6.4 Config.** `fmn-config` parses the actual shipped file shapes exactly (plain/quoted/block scalars with chomping, tuple-string values, comments, duplicate-key policy, UTF-8, depth/size limits; precise diagnostics otherwise). Reference precedence (defaults → user file → CLI). The `tex_templates.yml` concept is reborn as **fmd-math preamble packs** — named macro/symbol bundles (§11.4) — with a compatibility mapping for the common templates.

**6.5 One RNG.** `fmn-core` exposes a single seeded stream: fnp-random **PCG64DXSM** (bit-exact to NumPy's for explicit seeds), with named substreams derived per subsystem (layout jitter, stream-line seeding, sampling) so features don't perturb each other's sequences, snapshot/restore into SceneState and the replay journal, and OS entropy when unseeded. Render-affecting map iteration uses ordered maps only. Substreams additionally support **keyed per-frame forks** (Rev 4): a frame's stream state derives from *(substream id, frame index)*, never from sequential pulls consumed in scheduler completion order — the property that makes frame-parallel rendering (§9.5) replay-identical by construction, and the reason per-thread completion-order RNG is on §10.5's permanent refusal list.

**6.6 The deterministic math layer (`fmn-dmath`).** Unchanged from Rev 2 and still load-bearing: `std`'s transcendentals defer to platform libm and differ across glibc/macOS/WASM, and this engine is transcendental-dense (arc construction, per-vertex `atan2` joints, rate functions, glow falloffs, `tanh` normalization, Euler conversions). Certified determinism rides on an owned fixed-implementation elementary-function layer — documented accuracy, uniform on every certified target, bit-locked by cross-platform vectors in CI. `standard` may use fast paths; `certified` uses fmn-dmath exclusively. fmn-dmath is itself a first-class SIMD target (§17.3): its fixed-coefficient, fixed-order polynomial kernels vectorize bit-reproducibly, which accelerates the transcendental-dense certified path — arc construction, per-vertex joints, rate functions — without touching this contract.

**6.7 Canonical hashing & serialization (`fmn-hash`).** An owned SHA-256-class primitive plus versioned canonical serialization (magic, endianness, schema ids, checksums, field order, size limits, unknown-field and migration policy) shared by the cache, snapshots, provenance, asset/font hashes, and repro bundles.

**6.8 Rate functions.** The complete catalog, same formulas (they are good), locked at 10⁴ samples; `squish_rate_func` and `not_quite_there` marked as combinators in the schema.

---

## 7. Chisel: the geometry kernel (fmn-geom)

**7.1 Path model.** `QuadPath` implements the shared-anchor invariant of §1.2 formally, with exact fixtures for empty/one-point/one-curve/closed/multi-subpath before any higher-level geometry (G0). `consider_points_equal` tolerance and `VectorizedPoint` degeneracies preserved as API behavior.

**7.2 Cubic reduction — one converter.** A single **error-bounded cubic→quadratic converter** (cu2qu-class: monotone subdivision to a stated tolerance) serves every path: API cubics, SVG import, font outlines (already quadratic from TrueType — zero-loss), smoothing. The Reference's crude two-quad splitter is retired; the tolerance default is chosen in G0's look study so curve fidelity visibly exceeds the Reference's.

**7.3 Proportion & length — correct under the original names.** `get_arc_length` returns arc length (adaptive Gauss–Legendre via fsci quad); `point_from_proportion` and `MoveAlongPath` use a per-revision inverse-arclength LUT — constant-speed motion, as every user always assumed it worked. `quick_point_from_proportion` remains as the documented fast approximation. Behavior Note: paths animate at slightly different (correct) pacing than the Python engine; dashes, tips, and tracers place by true length.

**7.4 Planar path booleans.** Unchanged from Rev 2: the deterministic **flatten-and-clip boolean ships first** (certified at W2 — escape hatch, reference, fuzz target), the curve-aware pipeline (fat-line-pruned quad–quad intersection + Newton polish, winding classification, stitching) replaces it progressively; double-double predicates without exactness overclaims; a written topology spec per degenerate class; **topology-aware acceptance** (point-in-fill grids, winding equivalence, component/hole counts, Euler characteristic, boolean identities, multi-scale raster equivalence) plus captured skia-pathops fixtures and adversarial fuzzing.

**7.5 Space ops & rotation conventions.** Signature-for-signature space_ops; the quaternion/Euler module fixes scipy-`Rotation` conventions (sign, composition order, `"zxz"` extraction, gimbal behavior) as the documented semantics, tested at singularities — camera code written for manim means the same thing here.

**7.6 SVG as a document processor.** For user SVGs: XML tokenization with namespaces/entities, `viewBox`/`preserveAspectRatio`/units, nested transforms, `defs`/`use` with expansion limits and cycle detection, presentation-attribute and style cascade, group opacity, fill rules, stroke cap/join/dash, explicit accept/reject for clips/masks/gradients/patterns; security posture (no external entities or remote refs, bounded size/nesting/commands, finite-number validation). The dvisvgm-quirk replication of Rev 2 is deleted along with dvisvgm.

**7.7 Scalar fields.** An owned adaptive quadtree isoline extractor honoring the `min_depth`/`max_quads` API knobs (budget semantics), with well-defined traversal, truncation, orientation, boundary, and NaN behavior — ours, and good.

**7.8 Triangulation.** The ear-clipper (holes, deterministic tie-breaks, honest acceptance criteria — no Delaunay pretensions) as a utility for booleans, exports, and any future mesh work; the live fill path (§10) needs none.

---

## 8. Marionette: the mobject engine (fmn-mobject)

**8.1 Ownership by spike.** `Stage` arena + generational `Mob` handles + rooted lifetime + CoW snapshots — ratified or amended by G0's compiling object-model spike (detached construction, cross-group composition, multiple parents, removal with live handles, two-scene policy, copy, Python proxy identity across collection, live NumPy views across resize, updater closures, snapshot/restore). The public fluent API is what the prototype proves.

**8.2 The RecordBuffer.** Interleaved f32 records with typed field views — the representation zero-copy NumPy structured export requires — with custom user dtypes supported through the schema machinery, and the **view protocol** specified: exported views pin their buffer; resize is copy-on-resize (old views detach with NumPy-natural semantics); mutation through a view marks render state dirty; reallocation under a live view is impossible by construction. `aligned_data_keys`/`pointlike_data_keys`, data locking as copy-elision, resize-with-interpolation, and null-padding family alignment ported field-for-field. Rev 4 hardens the render-side story: the interleaved buffer remains **authoritative** — live NumPy structured views are the compatibility contract — but it is no longer what the hot loops read. The "optional SoA mirror" becomes **mandatory, lazy, revisioned render mirrors** feeding §10.8's compiled render state: animated fields materialize struct-of-arrays (or AoSoA sized to the SIMD tier, §17.3) at most once per frame; animations, updaters, and the field-lerp path run against that working form; synchronization back through the view protocol happens only when a live view or an API read demands it. While a *writable* live view exists, the affected object (or field, where the view is field-scoped) is conservatively invalidated each frame — a live view never silently receives weaker semantics to buy speed — and ranged editing APIs (`edit_points(range, …)`-class) exist as the precise-dirty opt-in.

**8.3 Copy semantics — manim's, because user code depends on them.** `copy()` recursively copies submobjects and ndarray attributes, keeps updater callables by reference, remaps family-internal attribute references, clears selected links — implemented to that contract (it is API semantics, not pixel trivia), plus `copy.copy`/`deepcopy`/pickle in the binding tier.

**8.4 Family, geometry queries, uniforms.** The full positional API (`next_to`, `arrange`, `to_edge`, `align_to`, …) locked by fixtures; bounding boxes with dirty propagation; the complete uniform inventory including the four clip planes, `stroke_behind`, depth-test, fixed-in-frame mix, per-kind AA widths.

**8.5 Render-order model.** The Reference's actual batching semantics — top-level sort by `z_index` with stable scene order, adjacent compatible-item batching, depth-test and fixed-in-frame partitions — kept as *semantics* (what draws over what is meaning, not pixels), with ordering-trace fixtures for shared submobjects, multiple parents, mixed z, and stroke-behind.

**8.6 Updaters & the builder — corrected where the Reference is buggy.** Insertion-ordered dt/non-dt updaters with suspend/resume; `add_updater(call=True)` runs the update **once** (the Reference's double-call is a bug — Behavior Note); `Group.__add__` returns a new group like `Mobject.__add__` (Behavior Note); ValueTrackers; `always_redraw`/`f_always`. The `.animate` builder implements the Reference's real rules: one-time animation arguments, `override_animate` no-chaining, dynamic target lookup.

**8.7 Serialization.** Arena snapshots in the §6.7 format (+ `.npy` per field via fnp-io) back SceneState, Studio undo, replay barriers, and fixtures; the snapshot's scope is §13.4's, with no claim to serialize Python closures.


---

## 9. Choreo: the animation engine (fmn-anim)

**9.1 The Animation contract.** The §1.3 constructor surface field-for-field; lifecycle and `get_sub_alpha` lag semantics exact; `prepare_animation` accepts `Animation | _AnimationBuilder` and rejects bare methods, precisely as the pinned Reference does.

**9.2 One clock, manim's sample points.** The **`RationalFrameClock`**: i64 frame index over fps, drift-free — emitting the *same nominal sample sequence* as the Reference (`arange(0, run_time, 1/fps) + 1/fps` semantics: no alpha-zero progression frame, `begin()`'s separate zero-interpolate, upward duration rounding, `finish()`'s `final_alpha_value`) computed exactly in rational time. Scene code experiences manim's timing model without manim's float drift. Behavior Note: hour-long renders do not accumulate error. Adaptive or variable frame sampling is **refused permanently** (§10.5): the sample points are semantics, and every scheduler freedom in §17 is defined relative to them.

**9.3 The frame order.** Exactly the Reference's six steps — animation `update_mobjects(dt)` → animation `interpolate(alpha)` → time advance → **scene updaters over post-interpolation state** → capture → emit — because `always_redraw`-style scenes semantically depend on it. The update-order corpus locks it: dt-updaters on animated mobjects, target-with-updater, suspend both ways, `wait`/`wait_until`, skip, final samples, unequal run_times, `time_span`. Rev 4 adds a formal boundary at step five without reordering anything: **capture freezes an immutable `FramePacket`** — the frame's index and alpha, camera state, RNG substream states, and revisioned references into §10.8's compiled render state — after which that frame no longer depends on mutable scene state. Everything before the freeze is the serial front-end; everything after (render-plan synchronization, binning, rasterization, color conversion, emission) consumes only the packet. This is what makes the §17.4 pipeline legal while leaving these six steps untouched.

**9.4 Mechanisms & timeline algebra.** Five mechanism families implemented once; the **80** classes as parameterizations, each Ledger-mapped; the `align_data` alignment path under a 10³-pair fixture corpus (structural: point counts, family shapes, interpolation endpoints); `AnimationGroup`/`Succession`/`LaggedStart(Map)` interval math; `squish_rate_func`/`time_span` through one normalized-alpha pipeline. The declarative `Timeline` (keyframes, labels, seek — the Studio scrubbing and serialized-player substrate) compiles to the same primitives.

**9.5 Segment purity — the frame-parallel contract.** Choreo classifies every `play()`/`wait()` segment automatically by its effect signature (§13.4). A segment is **pure** when each of its frames is a function of the begin-state CoW snapshot (§8.1) and its alpha alone: no dt-updaters, no `always_redraw`/`f_always` closures, no stateful tracers (`TracedPath`, `TracingTail`, `AnimatedBoundary`), no scene updaters, no callbacks with unclassified effects. Pure segments are **embarrassingly parallel across frames**: worker *k* reconstructs frame state from the snapshot plus α(k) and the keyed per-frame RNG fork (§6.5), rasterizes, and hands the result to the ordered emitter (§14.1), which sequences by frame index regardless of completion order. Stateful segments serialize their front-end and lean on the §17.4 pipeline instead. The classification is recorded per segment in the replay journal; because misclassification would be a correctness bug, the classifier is conservative — any unrecognized effect demotes the segment to stateful. On an 8-core laptop this collapses to Rev 3's behavior; on a 96-core workstation it is near-linear, and it is the single biggest CPU lever in the plan.

## 10. Lumen: the renderer (fmn-render)

**10.1 One semantic renderer, multiple execution engines — built for beauty.** With conformance dropped, Rev 2's dual-backend collapses; Rev 4 sharpens what "one renderer" means. Lumen is one renderer **semantically**: one draw-order model (§8.5), one definition of clipping, strokes, fills, color, and camera, one compiled render IR (§10.8), one primitive corpus and correctness suite, one set of explicitly stated numerical tolerances. Beneath that single semantics sit multiple **execution engines** — the **certified CPU engine** (canonical arithmetic; the definition of the bits), the **fast CPU engine** (mixed precision, SIMD tiers, FMA — §6.1, §17.3), and the standard-only **annex engines** (Metal, CUDA — §10.7) — which share the IR and the test suite, never a lowest-common-denominator kernel, and may be independently optimized but never semantically divergent. Fast-CPU and annex engines are held to an explicit, versioned **visual-equivalence budget** against certified reference frames (perceptual metrics plus max-error bounds, §16.3); the certified engine is held to bits. The brief is unchanged: mathematically exact coverage, gorgeous strokes, correct compositing, deterministic output, on any CPU, with the Reference's *look* (§1.5's kept constants) as the calibrated aesthetic target — the design Rev 1 wanted, now unencumbered by any duty to reproduce GPU workarounds.

**10.2 Fill.** Tiled scanline **nonzero-winding coverage evaluated analytically on the curves**: quadratic segments y-monotonized by splitting at the vertical-tangent parameter; per scanline, exact segment intersections from the closed-form quadratic root; signed trapezoidal area accumulation per cell — no triangulation, no signed-alpha tricks, no orientation bookkeeping. Perspective handled honestly: projected quadratics are rational in screen space, so 3D paths are evaluated in homogeneous coordinates or adaptively subdivided to tolerance. Interior color for per-vertex `fill_rgba` gradients uses a **defined interpolation field** (arc-length-parameterized boundary interpolation with mean-value coordinates in the interior — specified, tested, and stable under subdivision). Winding-consistent self-intersection behavior; `fill_border_width` as a principled inner border stroke. The general quadratic machinery is the *fallback*, not the toll road: §10.8's primitive hints route lines, circles/arcs, rectangles, dots, and glyph instances to specialized kernels, interiors of classified tiles fill as vectorized spans, and the scanline evaluator computes exact coverage only where edges actually are.

**10.3 Strokes.** True curve-distance strokes: exact/high-accuracy signed distance to the quadratic within conservative slabs; **round caps** on open ends; round/bevel/miter joins with a real miter limit plus a smooth "auto" join tuned in the look study; width and color interpolated by **arc length**; `flat_stroke` vs camera-facing 3D construction both supported; the smoothstep AA profile at the familiar ~1.5 px weight. Every one of these is visibly better than the ≤32-segment ribbons it replaces — which is the point.

**10.4 3D, camera, lighting — the kept look.** Painter's order by the §8.5 batching model; opt-in depth-test against per-tile f32 depth; clip planes. Surfaces: fixed UV-grid tessellation, perspective-correct interpolation, and the Reference's `finalize_color` lighting ported as-is — `(reflectiveness, gloss, shadow)`, light at (−10, 10, 10), Surface defaults `(0.3, 0.2, 0.4)`, `dark_shift = 0.2` — because that shading *is* the 3b1b look. `CameraFrame` on §7.5's conventions; the Reference's projection constants; `is_fixed_in_frame` float-mix; true-dot radial glow; image splats with the §10.6 texture policy. AA by **adaptive coverage, not full-frame brute force** (Rev 4): frames render at native output resolution; tiles are classified (§10.8) as empty, fully covered, simple-edge, or complex-edge; interiors fill as vectorized spans; analytic coverage is evaluated only near edges; and 2×/4× edge supersampling applies only to complex-edge cells (thin overlapping strokes, dense self-intersections, high-frequency 3D silhouettes), with the resolve **fused into the coverage pass** so the supersampled buffer never makes a second trip through memory. Full-frame 2×/4× SSAA spent most of its work on pixels that were empty or fully covered; the adaptive scheme spends it where the picture is. `certified` runs the canonical analytic path everywhere — classification there is a scheduling choice that cannot change bits (§10.5) — and a forced-SSAA knob remains for A/B comparison and debugging. The AA profile, the ~1.5 px weight, and the escalation thresholds are calibrated once against Reference imagery in G0's look study so defaults read as "the same feel, cleaner."

**10.5 Determinism & parallelism — the contract.** Rev 4 states once the rule every optimization in §17 must honor. **The parallelism contract:** (a) a frame's bits are a pure function of *(begin-state snapshot, α, frame-indexed RNG state, input closure)* — never of thread count, scheduling order, or machine load; (b) tiles are write-disjoint and composite in fixed order; (c) reductions are fixed-order and **lane-count-independent** — no horizontal sums whose association varies with vector width, the trap that would silently break bit identity across SIMD build tiers; (d) no FMA and no fast-math on certified paths; (e) frames are emitted in frame-index order regardless of completion order; (f) every engine/backend identity is journaled into the input closure (§16.7). Anything that cannot honor (a)–(f) lives in `standard`, labeled — never silently, per §15.2's own rule. Three tempting things are **refused permanently**: GPU work anywhere in the certified path; adaptive/variable frame sampling (§9.2); per-thread RNG consumed in completion order (§6.5). Thread-count-independent output is verified at {1,4,16} threads per commit and at high counts ({32,96}+) on a weekly cadence — the property is structural, so per-commit 128-thread CI would be waste. `certified` adds canonical raster arithmetic: fixed-point screen coordinates and integer coverage accumulation at defined precision, explicit rounding, fmn-dmath transcendentals — within the certified engine the scalar path is the definition and every SIMD tier must match it bit-for-bit. G0's determinism spike (one nontrivial frame hashed on linux-x86-64/linux-aarch64/macos-aarch64/windows-x86-64) decides whether floating suffices or fixed-point is adopted.

**10.6 Textures & images.** Bilinear filtering, defined wrap/orientation/alpha/color-space behavior; decode via fmn-codec, exotic formats via the ffmpeg capability.

**10.7 WASM and the Accelerator Annex.** WASM tier 1 (frame renderer, single-threaded default; threads only under atomics + cross-origin isolation) and tier 2 (serialized-timeline player) are in-architecture; suite crates audited for the wasm target under the closure work. Rev 3's Metal annex is promoted to the **Accelerator Annex**: a backend trait behind the render IR (§10.8), with **frankentorch as the only GPU gateway** — Metal via ft today, CUDA via ft as an upstream-ledger spike (§2.9). No wgpu, ever: a dependency of that size is a D1 audit catastrophe and duplicates ft. Offload targets, ranked by ROI: stroke SDF + AA resolve (the dominant cost of typical 2D scenes, per-pixel independent), SSAA resolve + transfer functions, DotCloud/glow splats (overdraw-heavy, additive), 3D surface tessellation with the kept lighting, large fill coverage. Annex engines run the same IR and the same mathematics with **no bit promise**: standard mode only, never `certified`, excluded from the core gates, measured under their own PG-A profiles (§17.5), backend identity journaled into the input closure. The proof spikes move to **G0** (spike 8): discovering at W5 that the IR maps poorly to a GPU would be expensive, and discovering at G5 that CPU assumptions had already hardened would be worse. The annex's first production home is **Studio preview** on Apple silicon (§13.5, §17.6) — where latency matters, unified memory makes the handoff nearly free, and bits don't.

**10.8 The compiled render plan: retained IR, revisions, and caches.** Rev 3 rebuilt the world every frame; Rev 4 makes Lumen **retained**. Between Marionette's authoritative state and the engines sits a compiled, backend-neutral render IR — `PathTable`, `SegmentTable`, `StyleTable`, `InstanceTable`, `ImageTable`, and per-tile command lists — synchronized *lazily* from the RecordBuffer under §8.2's mirror rule, with backend-specific layouts derived from it (SoA/AoSoA sized to SIMD lanes on CPU; contiguous device arrays for CUDA; packed shared/private buffers for Metal). Every renderable resource carries **independent revisions** — topology, geometry, transform, style, visibility/order, image, camera-projection — and the distinctions pay directly: a color change does not regenerate curve coefficients; a translation does not recompute an object-space arc-length table; a camera move does not re-decode font outlines. Each **compiled path** retains its y-monotone quadratic splits, screen-independent coefficients, object- and screen-space bounds, arc-length LUT (§7.3), conservative stroke slabs, fill winding metadata, primitive hint, previous tile coverage, and old + new dirty bounds.

**Primitive hints** route semantic shapes off the general quadratic solver: line/polyline → capsule-distance kernel; circle/arc → direct arc kernel; rectangle/rounded rectangle → specialized coverage; dot → radial kernel; image → sampler kernel; nearly-linear quadratic → line fast path under an explicit screen-space error bound; glyph → cached path instance. Mutation through `set_points` or a writable live view invalidates the hint back to the general path. **Glyphs and repeated shapes are interned**: an outline is compiled once (content-addressed with the §11.3 span machinery and fmn-cache) and each occurrence is an *instance* — transform, color, clip, order — which for text-heavy mathematical scenes deletes the bulk of geometry duplication and binning work; the same mechanism serves dots, arrow tips, repeated graph nodes, and copied decorations.

Binning is **two-level**: object bounds → ~128×128 macrotiles → engine-sized fine tiles → stable per-tile command runs, sizes tuned per platform by the execution plan (§17.4), never by semantics. Command lists keep stable draw indices; transparent runs stay in exact painter order; annex binning uses deterministic count/prefix/scatter or a stable key sort, never unordered atomic appends. **Occlusion pruning is painter-order-safe**: a conservative back-to-front opaque-coverage mask per tile lets provably hidden commands be skipped when the result is provably unchanged; depth-tested 3D adds a hierarchical per-tile depth summary. And the dirty-region story generalizes into a **retained compositor — in export, not just preview**: object→tile dependencies tracked; both old and new bounds dirtied on movement; completed tiles cached keyed on *(command list, resource revisions, camera revision, output transform)*; static layer runs above/below animated content cached as units. Reused tiles are byte-identical, so reuse is PG-5-safe and **works under `certified`**. A `wait()` frame reduces to clock advance plus reuse; a blinking cursor does not re-rasterize a 4K frame. Per-frame allocation lives in bump arenas over pooled frame buffers — the zero-alloc steady state that §17.2 measures.

## 11. Scribe: text and native mathematics (fmn-text, fmn-tex ⇄ fmd-font, fmd-math)

The section that carries the pivot. There is no LaTeX anywhere in this program — not as a fallback, not as an option, not in CI. Mathematics is typeset by **fmd-math**, a clean-room TeX-mathematics layout engine living in franken_markdown, consumed by FrankenManim through **fmn-tex**. This is the program's hardest and proudest deliverable, and it is on the critical path by design.

**11.1 Fonts — bundled by default, sovereign always.** `fmd-font` (factored from fmd's `text.rs`, extended with the glyf outline decoder) parses and renders the bundled OFL set: **Computer Modern** (the default face — the 3b1b typographic identity), IBM Plex Sans, CM Typewriter (code), Noto Sans Math (symbol coverage). User TTFs load by path; family-name platform scanning is a convenience tier; CFF/CFF2, variable fonts, color glyphs, and bidi/complex shaping are honestly tiered out (§16.6) with fmd upstream items where they belong. There is no default that depends on the host machine: a bare install renders every built-in scene identically everywhere.

**11.2 Text & markup.** Native shaping (cmap→gids, kerning via kern+GPOS, bundled-face ligature sets — off by default, matching the familiar manim look), greedy line breaking with manim's width semantics (Knuth–Plass as an option), the manim markup tag set (`<span>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<tt>`, `<big>`, `<small>`, color attributes) with the `t2c`/`t2f`/`t2g`/`t2s`/`t2w` maps, justification/indent/alignment/line-spacing parameters at full constructor granularity. Output preserves `StringMobject` submobject-indexing conventions — `Text[3:7]` and `isolate=` are load-bearing across the corpus.

**11.3 Spans without hacks.** The Reference obtains substring→glyph maps by rendering every string *twice* through Pango/LaTeX with injected color labels and aligning the two renders via `cdist` + assignment — because its typesetters are black boxes. **Ours are not.** fmd-math and the text layouter emit a **semantic span map natively**: every output glyph and rule carries its source-span provenance by construction. `isolate`, `tex_to_color_map`, substring slicing, and `TransformMatchingTex/Strings` consume the span map directly; the assignment matcher (fsci-opt + cdist) remains for *shape*-based matching (`TransformMatchingShapes`) where it genuinely belongs. One of the pivot's cleanest wins: an entire fragile subsystem replaced by information we already have.

**11.4 fmd-math: the engine.** A math-*layout* engine in the KaTeX/Typst class, not a TeX macro processor:
- **Language surface.** The TeX math grammar as actually used: groups, sub/superscripts, `\frac`/`\dfrac`/`\tfrac`/`\binom`, radicals with indices, `\left…\right` and fixed-size delimiters, accents (`\hat`, `\vec`, `\dot`, `\tilde`, `\bar`, `\overline`/`\underline`, `\overbrace`/`\underbrace` with annotations), big operators with limits (`\sum`, `\int`, `\prod`, …), the operator-name set, Greek and the standard symbol vocabulary (backed by CM + Noto Math coverage), `\text{…}` islands, spacing commands, `\mathbb/\mathcal/\mathrm/\mathbf/\mathsf/\mathtt`, environments (`matrix` family, `cases`, `array`, `align*`-class multi-line with alignment points), colors, phantoms, `\stackrel`/`\overset`/`\underset`, and a **user macro tier**: `\newcommand`-style non-recursive substitution macros plus named **preamble packs** replacing tex_templates.yml.
- **Layout rules.** TeX's published mathematics: the eight atom classes and the inter-atom spacing table; display/text/script/scriptscript styles with correct style propagation (`\mathchoice`-class behavior); numerator/denominator shifts, rule thicknesses, script placement, and italic-correction/kerning behavior per the Appendix-G parameter family, over a **math-metrics table synthesized and hand-calibrated for the bundled faces** (axis height, x-height, quad, sup/sub shifts, radical parameters, fraction gaps) in the spirit of OpenType MATH; extensible delimiters and wide accents assembled from CM's extension glyphs, with **drawn-path construction as the universal fallback** so no requested size can fail.
- **Output.** Glyph outlines (via fmd-font) and rules as quadratic paths with the §11.3 span map — consumed by FrankenManim as VMobjects and by fmd as HTML/PDF vector output. Deterministic: same string + pack ⇒ identical paths, everywhere.
- **Quality bar.** Side-by-side indistinguishable-at-a-glance from LaTeX output on the corpus, judged in the Look Gallery; spacing rules verified against the published parameters, not against pixels.

**11.5 Coverage: the ratchet with no net.** With no fallback, coverage discipline replaces fallback discipline. The **corpus harvest** (G0): extract the TeX-string multiset from the pinned `3b1b/videos` tree and the Reference's own constructors — static extraction plus a one-time instrumented run where feasible — ranking constructs by occurrence. fmd-math ships in **construct tiers** (T1: the §11.4 surface, covering the overwhelming mass of real formulas; T2: the long tail — `\substack`, uncommon decorations, exotic environments — scheduled by corpus rank). An unsupported construct is a **precise, named error** ("`\substack` is not yet supported; tier T2, tracked at …") — never silence, never garbage — and the public coverage ratchet (occurrence-weighted and unique-string, with parse-vs-layout success split out) is a headline project metric. `Tex`/`TexText` cache typeset results content-addressed in fmn-cache. Typesetting also moves off the first-frame critical path (Rev 4): before the first `play()`, the runtime walks the constructed scene and **preflights** every static `Tex`/`Text` string across the worker pool — parallel typesetting, parallel glyph-outline decode in fmd-font, fmn-cache warmed — so PG-4's cold-start budget is met by design and PG-7's cached-path numbers are the common case rather than the lucky one.

**11.6 De-TeXing the incidental classes.** The Reference routes several non-math classes through LaTeX because LaTeX was there: `Brace` is `\underbrace{\qquad}`, Matrix brackets are a `\left[\begin{array}…` render, Checkmark/Exmark are pifont glyphs, `DecimalNumber` splits digits and letters across two typesetters. Rev 3 makes them native and better: **`Brace` becomes a parametric path generator** (correct at any width, no typesetting involved); **Matrix delimiters use fmd-math's extensible-delimiter engine directly**; Checkmark/Exmark draw from bundled glyphs; **`DecimalNumber` is pure native text** (one face, glyph-recycling updates, correct formatting edge cases). This removes the deepest early dependency on math typesetting from the library's critical path and yields objects that scale properly by construction.

**11.7 Code & Markdown.** `Code` binds fmd's highlighter over CM Typewriter. `MarkdownMobject` (enhanced tier): fmd's parser + Scribe layout + fmd-math inline mathematics — documents and slides as animatable content, and the same renderer that powers fmd's own HTML/PDF math.

## 12. Menagerie & Atlas: the mobject library (fmn-library)

The 161 non-runtime, non-animation classes of Appendix A as thin compositions over Marionette + Chisel + Scribe.

**12.1 Geometry.** The Arc lineage (one clean arc-density rule replaces the Reference's three inconsistent conventions — Behavior Note), the Line lineage (Arrow/StrokeArrow/Vector, tip-attachment algebra placing by true arc length), CubicBezier, polygons, rectangles, TipableVMobject — constructors locked by structural fixtures (point counts, layouts, dimensions) against the Reference where formulas coincide.

**12.2 Coordinate systems (Atlas).** The `CoordinateSystem` protocol (`c2p/p2c`, graphing with discontinuity handling, Riemann rectangles, areas), `Axes`/`ThreeDAxes`/`NumberPlane`/`ComplexPlane`/`NumberLine` with tick and number placement locked by glyph-sequence tests (all native text now); `ParametricCurve` t-range/epsilon semantics; `FunctionGraph`; `ImplicitFunction` over §7.7.

**12.3 Numbers & structure — de-TeX'd.** Per §11.6: native `Brace` path family (BraceLabel/BraceText compose with Scribe), fmd-math Matrix delimiters, native Checkmark/Exmark, pure-text `DecimalNumber`/`Integer`. SurroundingRectangle/BackgroundRectangle/Cross/Underline; `BulletedList`/`Title` on Scribe; the `interactive.py` controls bound to Proscenium events.

**12.4 3D & fields.** The three_dimensions census; `ParametricSurface` UV-grid semantics; `VectorField` (sampling, `tanh` normalization on fmn-dmath), `TimeVaryingVectorField`, `StreamLines` on fsci-integrate's adaptive RK45 with dense output — tuned for quality, seeded from the single RNG's named substream — and `AnimatedStreamLines`; `TracedPath`/`TracingTail` tracing by true length; DotCloud/TrueDot/GlowDot(s); ImageMobject via fmn-codec; `ThreeDModel` via the OBJ-subset reader.

**12.5 Graph mobjects (enhanced, fnx)** and **12.6 Data mobjects (enhanced, fp).** As §2.4–2.5: audited layout kernels and group/sort determinism rules before anything enters certified renders; traversal/flow/layout-transition animations; CSV ingestion; `TableMobject` through Scribe.

**12.7 Drawings.** The whimsy shelf — pure consumers, ported late, one self-golden each; former Tex-backed members now native.

---

## 13. Proscenium: scene runtime, interactivity, the Studio (fmn-scene, fmn-studio, fmn-cli)

**13.1 Scene.** The §1.4 state machine on the rational clock: `construct`, add/remove/bring_to_front/clear, `play/wait/wait_until`, `SceneState` snapshot/restore at its Reference scope, `EndScene`, `ThreeDScene` defaults, presenter mode/hold loops, `show()`, `BlankScene`, the windowed fps=30 override.

**13.2 Events & InteractiveScene.** The dispatcher and InteractiveScene's selection/grab/resize/color/clipboard behaviors, keyboard-map compatible.

**13.3 Iteration without dlopen.** The supervisor + scene-worker-subprocess architecture: code change → incremental rebuild → worker restart → restore nearest serialized checkpoint → replay from the last valid barrier. Crashes isolate to the worker. fmn-python preserves the literal IPython `embed()`/`checkpoint_paste()` workflow.

**13.4 Replay with an effect model.** The journal records commands and effects — play/wait/add/remove, the RNG substream states at barriers, camera/audio state, content hashes of every file/font/asset read, callback version hashes, ffmpeg invocations — with **opaque barriers** for non-replayable operations and conservative invalidation. Cheap when scenes are pure; correct when they aren't. The effect model doubles as §9.5's purity classifier — segments whose recorded effects are pure are eligible for frame-parallel execution — and as the pipeline's synchronization vocabulary: any operation that must observe rendered pixels is a **pipeline barrier** that drains in-flight frames (§17.4) before proceeding; ordinary manim scene code never hits one.

**13.5 The Studio.** Localhost with an explicit security model (loopback-only, per-request capability token, Host/Origin validation, size limits, no filesystem serving beyond embedded UI assets, event-rate limits, session expiry). Baseline stream: **multipart PNG** (we own PNG); MJPEG as the ffmpeg-accelerated option; browser-local WASM rendering as the endgame. The Accelerator Annex's first production duty is this preview path (§10.7): on supported hardware the Studio renders through the annex engine by default — its speed is welcome here and its non-certified status is irrelevant, since preview frames carry no bit promise. Timeline scrubbing over Timeline + checkpoints; the inspector (family tree, live record fields, uniforms, **typeset span maps**); debug overlays (tiles, control cages, bounds, winding, depth); a kitty/sixel TUI in the fp-frankentui lineage. Untrusted content renders only in the isolated worker.

**13.6 CLI & batch.** `fmn` keeps the Reference's flag surface where it still means something — write/skip/quality/resolution/open/fullscreen/presenter/GIF/transparent/`--vcodec`/`--pix_fmt`/quiet/write-all/ranges/embed-line/`--subdivide`/`--file_name`/`--prerun`/`--video_dir`/`--config_file`/`--clear-cache`/`--autoreload`/background color — with exit codes and flag interactions specified in the schema. TeX-toolchain-specific configuration is replaced by fmd-math pack selection; `--reproducible` selects certified determinism. `fmn batch` under asupersync with budgets and per-scene manifests. `fmn doctor` reports capabilities (ffmpeg fingerprint, fonts, cache).

---

## 14. Reel: the output pipeline (fmn-output over fmn-frame / fmn-codec / fmn-cache)

**14.1 Layering.** fmn-frame (buffers; pixel formats — RGBA8/BGRA8, RGBA16F intermediates where quality demands, NV12/P010 video planes, canonical RGBA for certified output; transfer functions) and fmn-codec below the renderer and library; fmn-cache below everything persistent; fmn-output orchestrates sinks, muxing, progress — including Rev 4's **ordered asynchronous emitter**: sequence-numbered frames from the pipeline (§9.5, §17.4) publish in frame-index order through a preallocated ring of frame slots, so Lumen never stalls on a sink and no sink ever observes an out-of-order or torn frame.

**14.2 Native codecs.** PNG decode across the real ecosystem (grayscale ± alpha, indexed + tRNS, 8/16-bit, Adam7, gamma/sRGB chunk policy, canonical-RGBA normalization, decompression-bomb rejection) and encode (stills, sequences, the Studio stream); JPEG decode (baseline + progressive, subsampling, restart markers, EXIF orientation, CMYK policy); GIF encode (median-cut + Floyd–Steinberg); y4m/raw; WAV in/out; SVG export (`vmobject_to_svg`) — trivial, since paths are native. PNG-sequence export encodes in parallel with **fixed DEFLATE block boundaries** (pigz-style): deterministic bytes on any thread count, so the canonical form survives under `certified`. Formats beyond the native set transcode through the one ffmpeg boundary or fail with a named capability error.

**14.3 The ffmpeg boundary — a negotiated sink.** `FFMPEG_PROTOCOL.md` v2 replaces Rev 3's fixed `rawvideo/rgba → vflip → eq` pipe with **negotiation**: fmn-frame renders in output orientation (no `vflip`, ever) and applies the intended transfer function once, natively (no obligatory `eq`); the sink negotiates pixel format (RGBA8/BGRA8 for alpha and compatibility, NV12 for ordinary 8-bit video, P010 for 10-bit/HDR-capable output, canonical RGBA for certified raw/PNG), orientation, transfer function, color primaries, range, row stride, and encoder. The arithmetic is the argument: at 3840×2160, RGBA8 is 33,177,600 bytes per frame against NV12's 12,441,600 — 2.67× less payload, roughly 1.99 GB/s versus 746 MB/s at 60 fps before counting extra copies — and annex engines convert on-device before any readback (§17.6). Frames flow through §14.1's preallocated asynchronous ring; the hot path never allocates, resizes, or synchronously flushes a frame-sized buffer; the in-flight budget is RAM-derived and config-visible (PG-6). **Hardware encoders enter here and only here**: since ffmpeg products are already excluded from certification by construction, `hevc_videotoolbox`/ProRes on macOS and `h264_nvenc`/`hevc_nvenc`/AV1 on NVIDIA are a documented standard-mode knob — `fmn doctor` reports what the installed ffmpeg offers, selection is explicit or `auto`, and the encoder identity lands in provenance. D2's one-external-tool rule is untouched: hardware encoding rides the same subprocess boundary. The protocol retains GIF mode, the **two-stage audio mux** (video first; then `-c:v copy -c:a aac -map …`), `--subdivide` outputs, insert files, and `--prerun` counting — testable against a fake-ffmpeg in CI, fingerprinted (path + content hash + version) into provenance. The same boundary serves media transcode (audio decode beyond WAV, exotic images) as a capability. D2's rules apply in full; certification excludes ffmpeg products.

**14.4 The cache.** Content-addressed on fmn-hash: atomic writes, cross-process locks, checksums, versioned namespaces, corruption recovery, traversal protection, defined eviction, size ceilings. Serves typeset results (fmd-math + text layout, keyed on string + pack + font hashes), fetched assets, and the replay journal.

**14.5 Sound.** The WAV/PCM mixer with a specified matrix: sample formats/rates with a named resampler, channel layouts, gain semantics (`gain`, `gain_to_background`), negative offsets, overlay-past-end, clipping policy, dithering, deterministic mix order, A/V sync; non-WAV inputs decode through ffmpeg; certified output is WAV.

## 15. The two front doors

**15.1 The Rust API — prototyped, then promised.** Idiomatic but recognizably manim: snake_case preserved; kwargs as `Default` config structs + builders generated from the schema. The fluent syntax is whatever G0's compiling prototype proves (current lean: scoped `stage` context + deferred-command `.animate` recording, which mirrors the builder semantics anyway).

**15.2 fmn-python — source-compatible, honestly.** The bridge presents the pinned `manimlib` module surface with normal Python object semantics: subclassing every exported base with real MRO/override dispatch (a subclass overriding `init_points`/`interpolate` is called back by the engine), writable `__dict__` and arbitrary attributes participating in copy remapping, custom `data_dtype`s, properties/descriptors, live `data`/`uniforms`/`submobjects` mutation under §8.2's view protocol, `copy`/`deepcopy`/pickle, weakrefs/identity/hashing, exception mapping, GIL and reentrancy rules, cross-thread restrictions. Import-surface conformance compares the actual wildcard namespace. **The promise is source compatibility and correct, beautiful output — explicitly not frame reproduction**: a scene renders as *this* engine renders it, per the Behavior Notes. Callback performance is class-tiered (§17.2), and acceleration transforms are labeled opt-ins, never silent. Rev 4 makes the binding-tax program explicit, because arbitrary Python callbacks remain the one serial, GIL-sensitive component no scheduler can dissolve: method-resolution and callback handles are cached; native→Python crossings are batched wherever semantics allow; the GIL is released across all native compilation, rasterization, conversion, and output waits; dirty propagation batches once per callback group rather than per field write; and rendering pipelines behind subsequent Python frame construction (§17.4), so the interpreter and the rasterizer overlap instead of alternating. Above the always-correct Python updater sits an **opt-in acceleration ladder** — batched Python updater (fewer crossings) → array updater (vectorized RecordBuffer operation) → native updater (Rust/engine-executable) — each an explicit substitution with identical semantics for its declared class, never a silent one. Callback-heavy scenes are detected and reported with their phase breakdown (§17.1), so the tax is visible before anyone tries to optimize around it.

**15.3 The corpus gate, re-scoped.** `VIDEO_CORPUS.lock` still pins an exact scene allowlist, helper commits, and asset manifest (with the CC BY-NC-SA fixture policy: private gallery fixtures, public permissive primitive corpus, per-scene attribution). The G4a criterion becomes: *the enumerated scenes run with source unedited under the documented shims (imports, asset-path virtualization, fonts) and pass structural assertions plus Look-Gallery review* — object counts, timings, bounding envelopes, and human-judged visual quality, not pixel diffs. Scenes whose TeX outruns the current fmd-math tier are marked pending-with-named-constructs, feeding the ratchet.

**15.4 Custom GLSL — scoped small.** With pixel conformance gone, the arbitrary-GLSL surface shrinks to its honest core: `set_color_by_code`/custom shader folders are **excluded from the compatibility claim** (Strategy A wording), with a short list of **known-corpus native adapters** (Strategy B: the fractal-uniform protocols) maintained only as far as the gallery allowlist needs them. A restricted GLSL interpreter (Strategy C) stays banked as a possible future decision.

**15.5 What the front doors do not promise.** Python scenes are Python programs (they may import real NumPy, do I/O); certification claims apply to the native engine and to Python scenes only as far as §16.7's closure captures them. WASM tiers per §10.7; Python-in-browser is out of scope.

## 16. The Gauntlet: verification for correctness and beauty (fmn-conformance)

The Gauntlet reorients from "match the Oracle" to "be provably correct, visibly good, and never regress."

**16.1 The Parity Ledger — symbol-granular, semantics-tiered.** Rows are symbols and behaviors: module · symbol · kind (class/method/property/function/constant/CLI flag/config key) · wildcard-exported? · signature/defaults · semantic status (**same** | **improved** (Behavior-Note link) | **tiered** | **excluded**) · tests · notes. Covers the utility surface, CLI, and config keys; regenerates the coverage badge; CI fails on regression.

**16.2 One API schema.** Classes, methods, parameters, defaults, CLI flags, config keys — generating Rust structs/builders, fmn-python signatures, Ledger rows, docs. Drift between front doors is a build error.

**16.3 Three test planes.**
- **Correctness oracles.** Analytic ground truths (arc length vs closed forms; boolean identities; winding invariants; layout parameters vs the published TeX rules; color-model round-trips), property/metamorphic tests restricted to valid laws (integer-pixel translation equivariance; stateless resampling), and **structural fixtures against the Reference** where formulas intentionally coincide (constructor point arrays, family shapes, positional API results — loose f32 tolerances, since we compute in f64).
- **Self-goldens.** FrankenManim's own outputs, bit-locked per platform (and cross-platform under `certified`): the regression gate that actually blocks merges. Geometry snapshots at lifecycle points plus frame hashes for the primitive and feature corpora.
- **The Look Gallery.** Side-by-side renders (FrankenManim vs captured Reference imagery, one-time capture — no certified Pango/llvmpipe environment to maintain) reviewed by humans with perceptual metrics (SSIM, edge-distance, local-error percentiles) as *smoke alarms*, never hard gates. Its verdict vocabulary: at-least-as-good / different-but-fine (Behavior-Noted) / regression (fix).

Rev 4 adds a standing fourth check: the **engine-equivalence suite** — fast-CPU and annex engines rendered against certified-engine reference frames under §10.1's versioned visual-equivalence budget (perceptual metrics plus max-error bounds). Blocking for engine changes; informational elsewhere. The certified CPU engine remains the bit-exact reference that everything else is compared to.

**16.4 Tolerances.** Bit equality for self-goldens; ULP-scaled for owned f64 mathematics; loose f32 tolerances for cross-engine structural fixtures; explicit NaN/−0 handling.

**16.5 Fuzz & safety.** Parser fuzzing (SVG, TTF, YAML-subset, TeX strings) with resource-budget assertions — decompression bombs, nesting depth, pathological intersections, and malicious font tables are DoS surfaces even in safe Rust; fmd-math fuzzing (arbitrary token streams must error precisely, never hang or garble).

**16.6 The out-of-tier ledger.** The honest fringe — complex-script shaping, CFF, variable fonts, exotic mesh and media formats, arbitrary GLSL — each with rationale and a revisit trigger.

**16.7 Certified determinism & the input closure.** Unchanged in mechanism, stronger in scope: the complete content-hashed closure (sources/modules, engine + SUITE.lock, toolchain + target features, config bytes, RNG seeds, asset/font hashes, execution-engine/backend identities and SIMD build tier, locale/timezone, capability policy) ⇒ bit-identical raw frames, canonical PNG, and WAV across the certified matrix (linux-x86-64, linux-aarch64, macos-aarch64; windows-x86-64 in functional CI from W1 with bit-certification a separate declared decision). Provenance as a sidecar manifest. With LaTeX and Pango gone, **the only uncertified artifact class left is ffmpeg's**.

**16.8 The Behavior Notes.** The user-facing register of deliberate differences from classic manim — one evidence-backed entry each, written as migration guidance. Seeds: BN-01 single RNG (PCG64DXSM; seeded scenes reproduce within FrankenManim, not across engines); BN-02 rational clock on manim's sample points (no drift); BN-03 true arc length under the original names (constant-speed paths; length-true dashes/tips); BN-04 color: linear-light compositing with manim's gradient formulas; BN-05 native typesetting (metrics differ from LaTeX; quality bar documented); BN-06 renderer (analytic coverage, round caps, arclength stroke width — strokes and fills are cleaner than the GPU pipeline's); BN-07 Reference bugs fixed (Appendix C rulings); BN-08 de-TeX'd classes (§11.6); BN-09 one arc-density rule.

## 17. Performance model & CI-enforced performance gates

Rev 4's largest structural change: §17 stops being a monitoring section and becomes a **scaling design**. The organizing principle, stated once and enforced everywhere: **semantics and bits stay pinned; the scheduler gets freedom.** Every lever below is either bit-exact by construction — safe even under `certified` — or explicitly quarantined to `standard` and labeled, exactly as the Accelerator Annex already is. The scaling hierarchy, outermost first: multi-scene batch (asupersync, §13.6) → frame-parallel pure segments (§9.5) → pipelined frame stages (§17.4) → the tile pool within a frame → SIMD within a tile (§17.3). The outer two are embarrassingly parallel and near-linear to the whole machine; the inner two saturate long before 192 threads are busy — which is why tiles alone were never going to feed a Threadripper.

**17.1 Hypothesis, then evidence.** W1 publishes the checked-in baseline report (corpus, profiler, hardware, resolution, cache state, ffmpeg in/out, phase breakdown, raw data) before gates are finalized; the "Python churn dominates" premise is measured, not assumed. The report's **stage-level phase instrumentation** becomes a permanent fixture of every profiled run: scene/update, Python callback, geometry compilation, render-IR synchronization, binning, raster, color conversion, annex upload/readback, ffmpeg feed, and encode are timed separately — optimization begins by deleting work, and work that isn't measured can't be deleted.

**17.2 The gates.** Dedicated pinned bare-metal profiles (8-core x86-64 Linux; Apple-silicon macOS); multiple repetitions; median + robust dispersion; alert vs blocking thresholds; versioned baselines.

| Gate | Requirement |
|---|---|
| PG-1 End-to-end | `OpeningManimExample`-class scenes, 1080p export, vs the Python Reference under a pinned benchmark definition (hardware incl. its GPU, env, 30 fps config stated, cache state, ffmpeg in/out): ≤ 0.5× wall-clock at G2, ≤ 0.35× at G4 |
| PG-2 Rasterizer | canonical synthetic workloads (stated path/segment counts, overdraw, widths, curvature, transparency): ≥ 300 Mpx/s fill-coverage equivalent, ≥ 120 Mpx/s stroke at 8 threads; per-workload baselines versioned |
| PG-3 Throughput | ≥ 60 fps 1080p interactive preview on the median primitive scene; ≥ 30 fps 4K export on typical 2D scenes |
| PG-4 Latency | cold CLI → first frame < 150 ms (typesetting preflight, §11.5, is the design mechanism); worker-restart edit-to-frame < 1 s on a trailing edit of a 30 s pure scene |
| PG-5 Determinism | bit-identical raw frames across runs, {1,4,16} threads per commit — frame-parallel and pipelined schedules included — {32,96}+ threads weekly, and the certified matrix (`--reproducible`) |
| PG-6 Memory | ≤ 1.5 GB peak on the 4K 3D gallery under the default in-flight budget (RAM-derived and config-visible; each in-flight 4K RGBA frame ≈ 33 MB); zero leaks over a 1 h soak; **zero steady-state heap allocations per frame** on the primitive corpus (bump arenas + pooled buffers — the allocation count is a sharper regression tripwire than wall-clock) |
| PG-7 Typesetting | fmd-math median corpus formula < 3 ms cold, < 100 µs cached; 10k-glyph text layout < 20 ms |
| PG-8 Binding tax, by class | native built-ins ≤ 1.10× Rust; per-frame-callback, point-transform-callback, and dynamic-subclass classes each carry their own published budget |

**Scaling profiles — published, then ratcheted.** The absolute gates stay pinned to the two bare-metal profiles above so numbers remain comparable across releases; scaling gets its own annex rather than new absolute gates: parallel efficiency at {1, 8, 32, 96} threads ({128} where available) for raster-bound and frame-parallel workloads, published per release, alert-first and graduating to blocking once two releases of baseline exist. **PG-A — annex profiles.** Accelerator engines are measured on their own pinned profiles (one Apple-silicon Max-class machine; one RTX-4090-class CUDA machine) across the same scene classes, gate **annex changes only**, and never gate core merges: the CPU engine must stand on its own so acceleration can never mask a core regression. Beyond frames per second, the rig records bytes uploaded and read back per frame, resource-reuse and tile-cache hit rates, dirty-tile percentage, allocations per frame, render-team utilization, cross-NUMA steals, GPU occupancy, and encode queue depth. Benchmark scene classes span static, locally-dirty, full-screen animation, dense strokes, text-heavy, high-overdraw, and 3D; runs include short latency probes and sustained 10-minute thermal runs; outputs cover raw, PNG, software video, and hardware video.

**17.3 Mechanics — SIMD as a designed system.** "Scalar-complete first" survives as the *ordering*, not the destination, and D-15's "abstraction" is now named: **`std::simd`** on the pinned nightly, with **safe `#[target_feature]`** (target-feature-1.1 semantics: annotated safe functions are safely callable when the feature is statically enabled) so every kernel stays inside `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` — the D3 tension dissolves. Dispatch is by **build tier**, not per-call runtime detection: portable / x86-64-v3 (AVX2) / x86-64-v4 (AVX-512) / aarch64 + NEON, because enabling the feature crate-wide via build flags is precisely what makes the calls safe, and SUITE.lock's certified target-feature sets (§2.8) already govern exactly this. Distribution ships per-tier artifacts selected at install/launch (W11); no per-call `unsafe` dispatch trampoline exists anywhere. The certified lane rules restate §10.5's contract: no `mul_add`, no fast-math, reductions in fixed order with lane-count-independent trees; within the certified engine the scalar path is the definition every tier must match bit-for-bit. The hot list, in ROI order: point-transform passes, field lerp, scanline quadratic-root evaluation, stroke-SDF slabs, color transfer functions, PNG filter/unfilter, WAV mixing — and fmn-dmath itself (§6.6). The rest of the mechanics live in the retained plan of §10.8 — tile-local scratch, conservative two-level binning, per-path revision caches, the retained compositor, display-list and tile reuse across `wait()` in export as well as preview — and the order of operations is fixed: instrument (§17.1) → eliminate work and copies (§10.8, §14.3) → pipeline (§17.4) → vectorize (this section) → offload (§17.5). Hand-vectorizing the full-work renderer first would optimize work that should not exist.

**17.4 Parallelism — the frame pipeline and the execution planner.** The deterministic frame loop persists; Rev 4 builds the system around it. **The pipeline:** after §9.3's FramePacket freeze, stages overlap across frames — scene update and Python callbacks for frame N+2, render-plan synchronization and binning for N+1, rasterization for N, color conversion and sink submission for N−1 — behind a **bounded in-flight queue** (interactive preview 1–2 frames; ordinary offline export 3–6; high-core export enough to occupy the render teams; annex engines 2–4, sized by surface memory and latency), with ordered emission (§14.1) and pipeline barriers from the effect model (§13.4). **Pure segments** (§9.5) additionally fan whole frames out across render teams. **Topology:** `fmn-platform` gains a `HardwareTopology` capability — physical/logical cores, performance classes, cache groups and NUMA nodes, SIMD tiers, annex devices, available memory, encoder capabilities — processor-group-aware on Windows, where systems above 64 logical processors span groups and explicit scheduling code must know it. From it, `fmn-runtime` derives an **`ExecutionPlan`**: engine, frames in flight, render-team count and threads per team, tile and macrotile dimensions, SIMD tier, scratch sizes, output pixel format. **Teams, not one flat pool:** a small latency-oriented scene/update team; one render team per in-flight frame — on a 96-core part the first experiments are three 32-core teams or four 24-core teams, never 192 hardware threads fighting over one frame — and an output team feeding conversion and the ffmpeg pipe from SMT siblings, which don't compete for the vector ports. Within a team: physical cores first, SMT enabled only after measurement; one scratch arena per worker; local work queues with one owner per tile; no global hot atomics or shared counters; coarse work stolen locally before crossing CCD/NUMA domains; frame buffers first-touched by the team that renders them; small read-only command metadata replicated across domains when that avoids remote reads. `standard` caches autotuning results under the hardware fingerprint; `certified` runs its fixed declared configuration — and no schedule can change bits, because §10.5's contract binds every one of them. Multi-scene parallelism remains asupersync's `batch` job only; asupersync never enters the frame loop.

**17.5 The Accelerator Annex** (was "Metal annex"). Spike-gated in **G0** (spike 8); standard-only; never `certified`; measured under PG-A; blocking for annex changes only. Engines: Metal via frankentorch now, CUDA via ft as the §2.9 upstream-ledger item. First production duty: Studio preview (§10.7, §13.5). Offload set, ordering rules, and the no-wgpu decision in §10.7; platform specifics below.

**17.6 Platform playbooks.** Behavior keys on **introspected topology, never marketing names** — one product family spans radically different machines (a previous-generation Apple Max part with 546 GB/s of unified bandwidth out-muscles a newer base or Pro configuration; "Threadripper" tops out at 96 cores / 192 threads on the PRO 9995WX, while 128 cores means EPYC 9755 with 12 memory channels). Current exemplars, recorded as design context:

- **Apple silicon (M4/M5 class).** NEON is the baseline SIMD tier and `std::simd` lowers cleanly; size the pool to physical cores and let macOS place P/E work via QoS — user-interactive/-initiated for scene, render submission, and preview-critical stages; utility for caching and offline output; no core pinning (no clean no-`unsafe` API exists, and output is thread-count-independent so placement cannot affect bits anyway); no busy waits; jobs sized to amortize wake-ups; platform-sized padding against false sharing. The wall is **bandwidth, not FLOPs** (M5 base: 4P+6E at 153 GB/s; M5 Max: up to ~614 GB/s and a 40-core GPU), so §10.4's fused SSAA resolve and §10.8's reuse matter more here than anywhere. This is the annex's home turf: unified memory makes the CPU↔GPU handoff nearly free through ft shared buffers — compute kernels for transforms, bounds, and bin construction; tile-shader/threadgroup techniques keeping tile-local coverage and compositing on-chip (Apple's TBDR architecture rewards exactly this); memoryless attachments for pass-local results; threadgroup sizes taken from pipeline introspection, never CUDA habit; direct presentation for preview; GPU-side NV12/P010 conversion before any export readback. VideoToolbox H.264/HEVC/ProRes encode rides §14.3. SME/AMX and the Neural Engine are exploratory-tier at most: no safe Rust path, and the wrong shape for branchy analytic coverage.

- **High-core-count AMD (Threadripper PRO / EPYC).** The §17.4 hierarchy is the whole game: batch and frame-parallel segments feed 96–128 cores; tiles alone will not (a 1080p frame runs out of tiles and turns bandwidth-bound long before 192 threads are busy). Shard the pool by CCD — 32 MB of L3 per 8-core Zen 5 CCD — with node-local scratch and queues, cross-CCD stealing only for coarse work, and NUMA discipline dialed higher on EPYC's 12 channels. The x86-64-v4 build tier serves `standard` (Zen 5's native 512-bit datapaths roughly double kernel width over v3); `certified` stays lane-count-agnostic under the §10.5 rules. PNG encode, WAV mixing, and ffmpeg feeding ride SMT siblings — free threads that don't contend for the AVX-512 ports. Watch PG-6: in-flight 4K frames cost ~33 MB each, hence the RAM-derived, config-visible budget.

- **NVIDIA (RTX-4090-class CUDA).** Through ft only. Keep the scene **resident**: path headers, quadratic segments, styles, instances, image descriptors, macrotile bins, and fine-tile command lists live on-device (24 GB is ample for persistent scene state plus several 4K surfaces); upload only deltas — changed transforms, styles, geometry ranges, ordering metadata. Batch by pipeline class (solid fills, strokes, gradients, images, 3D triangles) within painter-order command runs; one block or cooperative block group per tile; raster and composite in stable command order; deterministic count/prefix/scatter binning — never one kernel per mobject, never unordered atomic appends. A small pinned-memory ring and multiple non-default streams overlap delta upload, rasterization, NV12 readback, and host-side ffmpeg submission; shared memory stages command or segment chunks only where it provably removes repeated global reads (excess shared-memory and register pressure costs occupancy). Don't over-engineer the bus: 4K readback at 30 fps is ~1 GB/s even in RGBA — ~0.4 GB/s in NV12 — against ~25 GB/s of PCIe gen4 ×16; plain pinned readback is fine, and zero-copy is an Apple-unified-memory luxury. NVENC rides §14.3 through the one ffmpeg boundary. Tensor and RT cores are the wrong tools for this workload — branchy geometric coverage, ordered compositing, and memory movement want ordinary CUDA execution, good binning, and a persistent layout.

## 18. Observability & developer experience

Owned structured tracing (scene → play → frame → phase → tile) with JSON + flame summaries, carrying §17.1's stage-level phase breakdown and §17.2's counters (reuse and cache-hit rates, dirty-tile percentage, allocations per frame, team utilization) in every profiled run; debug overlays; the sidecar provenance manifest; `fmn doctor` — which additionally reports the derived `ExecutionPlan` (§17.4) and the installed ffmpeg's hardware-encoder capabilities (§14.3); one-command repro bundles (scene + input closure) making every bug report a deterministic replay; the public **coverage ratchet dashboard** for fmd-math (§11.5) as a first-class DX artifact.

---

## 19. Workspace & crate map (cycle-free, two repos)

```
franken_markdown/  (existing repo, grows a workspace)
    fmd            the renderer/CLI as today
    fmd-font       Font factored from text.rs + glyf outline decoder      ← new
    fmd-math       the native TeX-math layout engine (§11.4)              ← new

franken_manim/     (workspace; toolchain pinned in SUITE.lock)
  crates/
    fmn-core       types, units, constants, color, the RNG stream, contract knobs
    fmn-dmath      owned deterministic elementary functions (§6.6)
    fmn-hash       canonical hashing + versioned serialization
    fmn-config     YAML-subset parser + typed config + preamble-pack registry
    fmn-platform   filesystem/process/clock/AssetFetcher capability traits + HardwareTopology introspection (§17.4)
    fmn-frame      frame buffers, pixel formats (RGBA/RGBA16F/NV12/P010), transfer functions
    fmn-codec      PNG/JPEG/GIF/WAV primitives (§14.2)
    fmn-cache      content-addressed store (§14.4)
    fmn-geom       Chisel (§7)
    fmn-mobject    Marionette (§8)
    fmn-anim       Choreo (§9)
    fmn-render     Lumen (§10): the compiled render IR + engines; `accel-annex` feature (`metal`/`cuda` via ft)
    fmn-text       Scribe I: shaping/layout/markup over fmd-font (§11.1–11.3)
    fmn-tex        Scribe II: Tex/TexText mobjects, span consumption, packs, over fmd-math (§11.4–11.6)
    fmn-library    Menagerie + Atlas (§12)
    fmn-scene      Proscenium runtime (§13.1–13.4)
    fmn-studio     supervisor, worker protocol, preview server, TUI (§13.3, §13.5)
    fmn-output     sink orchestration, the ffmpeg boundary, sound (§14)
    fmn-cli        `fmn` binary, progress; `batch` via asupersync (§13.6)
    fmn-conformance Gauntlet (§16)
    fmn-runtime    dual-mode runtime shims (house pattern); derives the ExecutionPlan from HardwareTopology (§17.4)
    fmn-python     PyO3 `manimlib` bridge (the one non-forbid(unsafe) crate) (§15.2)
```

Dependency edges point strictly downward; feature axes `wasm`, `accel-annex` (with `metal`/`cuda` sub-features), `batch`, `cli` default-off. Cross-repo governance: fmd-font/fmd-math changes ride the upstream ledger and SUITE.lock like any foundation crate — FrankenManim CI builds both repos from the lock. W11 owns packaging (binaries, wheels + ABI matrix, `manimlib` namespace policy, npm/WASM, font + license bundles, embedded UI assets, cache/config conventions, reproducible releases).

## 20. Workstreams & convergence gates

No MVP. Eleven full-strength workstreams sequenced by dependency, converging at gates that are integration checkpoints. G0 precedes construction; the sequence's biggest Rev-3 change is that **native typesetting joins the critical path early** (the library's text-bearing half depends on it, and there is no fallback behind it), partially offset by §11.6's de-TeXing, which removes math typesetting from Brace/Matrix/Number entirely.

### 20.1 Gate G0 — "The Laws of the Machine"

Compile-tested spikes and executed decisions; no W2–W11 interface freezes until green:

1. **Object-model & buffer-lifetime spike** (→ §8.1–8.2, §15.1): the ten lifetime scenarios, the live-NumPy-view protocol across resize/align/become/glyph-rebuild, and the compiling fluent-API prototype.
2. **Look study** (→ §10, §6.3): render the calibration set (fills with gradients, self-intersections, every joint/cap, glow, 3D lighting, text) with the analytic renderer against captured Reference imagery; fix the adaptive-AA defaults and escalation thresholds (§10.4), the AA profile, auto-join tuning, gradient behavior, and lighting match so "the same feel, cleaner" is a measured statement.
3. **fmd-math architecture spike** (→ §11.4): parse-and-layout proof over `\frac`, scripts, radicals, a `\left(\right)` at three sizes, a big operator with limits, and a small matrix — proving the atom/spacing engine shape, the CM metrics-synthesis method, and the extensible-delimiter strategy (glyph assembly vs drawn paths) before the crate's API freezes.
4. **Corpus harvest** (→ §11.5): the TeX-string multiset from the pinned `3b1b/videos` tree plus Reference constructors (static extraction + one-time instrumented run where feasible), ranked by occurrence — fmd-math's tier-1 definition and the ratchet's denominator.
5. **Python extensibility spike** (→ §15.2): a real subclass overriding `init_data`/`init_points`/`init_uniforms`/`interpolate` with engine callbacks, arbitrary attributes, and a custom dtype, against the prototype bridge.
6. **Determinism spike** (→ §6.6, §10.5): one nontrivial frame hashed on linux-x86-64 / linux-aarch64 / macos-aarch64 / windows-x86-64; decides floating vs fixed-point raster arithmetic and fixes the certified matrix.
7. **Dependency-closure audit** (→ §3 D1, §2.8): the full transitive closure generated and allowlisted; `SUITE.lock` committed (fmd's new crates included); the wasm-target audit stood up.
8. **Accelerator proof spike** (→ §10.7, §17.5): the render IR's highest-ROI stage — stroke SDF + AA resolve — expressed as ft kernels on Metal, end-to-end into a Studio-preview frame on Apple silicon, with the CUDA-via-ft feasibility question opened on the upstream ledger (§2.9). The point is to prove the IR maps to a GPU *before* W5 freezes it and before CPU-specific assumptions harden; the annex stays standard-only and PG-A-gated regardless of outcome.

### 20.2 The workstreams

| **W6** | **Typesetting** (cross-repo) | **fmd-font** factoring + outline decoder; **fmd-math** tier-1 per the harvest, with the span map, preamble packs, precise unsupported-errors, and the public ratchet; fmn-text shaping/markup/layout; fmn-tex integration + caching | W1; fmd repo; W2 (paths); Look Gallery via W5 |

### 20.3 The convergence gates

**G1 — "Core 2D."** The engine end-to-end without text: path invariant + kernel fixtures green; core Mobject/VMobject; Transform family, partial reveals, fades, updaters, trackers on the rational clock; the analytic renderer with look-study calibration; the primitive corpus (~25 scenes, ours, public) bit-locked as self-goldens, thread-count-invariant, and **Look-Gallery-approved against Reference imagery**; native PNG/y4m out.

**G2 — "The Native Word."** The flagship gate: **Text, MarkupText, and fmd-math tier-1 rendering with zero external software** — the harvest's tier-1 construct set laying out correctly (published-rule verification) and beautifully (Gallery), the span map driving `isolate`/`t2c`/slicing/`TransformMatchingTex`, the de-TeX'd classes (Brace/Matrix/Decimal/marks) native, `SVGMobject` for user files, typeset caching, the ratchet dashboard live, and fmd itself rendering `$…$` in HTML/PDF via the same crates. PG-1(G2), PG-7 enforced.

**G3 — "Depth & Motion."** 3D surfaces with the kept lighting; CameraFrame on the fixed conventions; depth, transparency, clip planes; dot clouds/images/textures; vector fields + StreamLines; events + InteractiveScene; the Studio baseline (supervisor/worker, PNG stream, scrubbing, TUI); **the annex serving Studio preview on supported Apple-silicon hardware** (W5's Metal backend), with a declared fallback: if the annex misses, G3 passes on CPU preview meeting PG-3 and the annex requirement moves to G5 with a public note — the reviews split on this (one would exclude the annex from every gate, one would gate it hard) and Rev 4 rules for a required-with-fallback middle: core gates stay CPU-only either way, so acceleration can never mask a core miss. PG-3; PG-A (annex-blocking only).

**G4a — "The Python Gallery."** VIDEO_CORPUS.lock frozen; the subclass bridge green; import conformance vs the wildcard namespace; asset virtualization; the enumerated scenes run source-unedited under documented shims, passing structural assertions + Gallery review; TeX-pending scenes named with their missing constructs; PG-8 class table published.

**G4b — "Certified Reproducibility."** `--reproducible` end-to-end: the input closure; fmn-dmath (and fixed-point if G0 so decided); bundled-assets-only; bit-identical raw frames + canonical PNG + WAV across the certified matrix with sidecar manifests. PG-1(G4), PG-5. G4a and G4b are siblings after G3.

**G5 — "Distribution & Leapfrogs."** W11 shipped (per-tier artifacts and selection UX included, §17.3); the WASM timeline player and browser Studio; Graph/DataFrame/Markdown mobjects; the fmd-math ratchet continuing past its G2 floor into tier-2; the Accelerator Annex broadened — the CUDA production backend from its ledger spike, wider platform tuning, the autotune corpus grown; the exploratory tier opened.

## 21. Risk register

| # | Risk | Sev | Mitigation | Pivot / kill criterion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | fmd-math misses quality or coverage — **now with no fallback** | **Critical** | it is the earliest big workstream (W6, G0 spike 3–4); tier-1 scoped by the harvest, not aspiration; published TeX rules as the correctness spec; precise unsupported-errors; the public ratchet; de-TeXing (§11.6) shrinks the blast radius | coverage misses the G2 checkpoint → gate amended publicly with a construct-sprint plan; quality misses → calibration sprint blocks G2; there is deliberately no LaTeX escape hatch to reach for |
| R2 | Renderer look falls short of the Reference's | High | G0 look study fixes parameters before W5 scales; the kept look constants; Gallery review as a standing gate input | look regressions block the gate that introduced them |
| R3 | CPU raster misses PG-2/PG-3 | High | work elimination before vectorization (§10.8: retained compositor, adaptive AA, primitive kernels, instancing); pure-segment frame parallelism + the pipeline (§9.5, §17.4); SIMD build tiers (§17.3); preview-resolution policy separate from export | the Accelerator Annex is already in-architecture (§10.7); never a GPU-only pivot (forfeits Linux/WASM/server) |
| R4 | Path-boolean robustness | Med | flatten fallback first (certified W2); topology spec; topology-aware acceptance; fuzzing | unsupported overlap classes route permanently to the fallback |
| R5 | Python callback tax | Med | batched crossings; per-class budgets | publish classes; labeled opt-in acceleration only |
| R6 | Pressure to chase upstream manim changes | Low | the Reference is an immutable design pin; new upstream ideas are adopted deliberately as features, not tracked as conformance | n/a |
| R7 | ffmpeg absent | Low | native y4m/PNG/GIF/WAV; capability errors; `fmn doctor` | n/a |
| R8 | Cross-repo coordination with franken_markdown | Med | fmd-font/fmd-math governed like foundation crates: SUITE.lock, upstream ledger, CI building both repos from the lock | interface churn → freeze fmd-math's public API at its G0 spike shape until G2 |
| R9 | Program bandwidth across eleven workstreams | High | governance: max simultaneously-active workstreams; gate ownership; required coverage before handoff; ADRs; review rules; stop conditions; a leapfrog-postponement policy that never weakens core work | breaching governance halts new activation |
| R10 | Python dynamic-subclass depth | High | G0 spike 5; the §15.2 contract; subclass PG-8 class | gaps tiered in the Ledger before G4a |
| R11 | Cross-platform deterministic FP | High | fmn-dmath; G0 spike 6; canonical raster arithmetic; ordered maps | fixed-point boundary or a narrowed certified matrix, declared in §16.7 |
| R12 | Zero-copy buffer lifetime | High | the §8.2 protocol; G0 spike 1 | copy-based export for affected surfaces, Behavior-Noted |
| R13 | Corpus era mismatch & licensing | Med | VIDEO_CORPUS.lock; era shims; the CC BY-NC-SA fixture policy | out-of-era scenes excluded per-scene with reasons |
| R14 | Untrusted-input security (fonts, SVG, TeX strings, Studio) | Med | parser budgets; D2 subprocess protocol; Studio security model; worker isolation | enforced continuously |
| R15 | WASM readiness of the closure | Med | G0 audit; tiering; pinned bindings | feature-gate or shim at fmn-platform; tiers adjust |
| R16 | Replay-cache unsoundness | Med | effect model; opaque barriers; conservative invalidation | divergent operation classes become barriers by default |
| R17 | Foundation API drift | Med | SUITE.lock; Gauntlet-diffed upgrades | ritualized |
| R18 | Windows behavior | Med | functional CI from W1; separate bit-certification decision | n/a |
| R19 | Distribution complexity; compile time & binary size (embedded fonts/UI) | Med/Low | W11 with its own gate; feature-gated assets; CI-measured budgets | n/a |
| R20 | Purity misclassification or a pipeline bug corrupts frame-parallel output | High | conservative classifier — unknown effects demote to stateful (§9.5); effect-model barriers (§13.4); ordered emit; PG-5 at {1,4,16} per commit and {32,96}+ weekly; classifications recorded in the replay journal | any observed misclassification demotes its effect class to stateful engine-wide until root-caused |
| R21 | Annex gravity: acceleration masks CPU regressions or creeps toward certification | Med | core gates CPU-only; PG-A blocks annex changes only; §10.5 bars GPU from certified by contract; backend identity journaled | annex work pauses whenever core PG-1–PG-3 regress |
| R22 | SIMD build-tier and team-topology matrix bloat (CI time, artifacts, tuning surface) | Med | tiers capped at {portable, v3, v4, NEON}; per-commit CI on the two pinned profiles, full matrix weekly; autotune caches capped + fingerprinted; W11 owns artifact-selection UX | drop a tier to weekly-only, or freeze team-autotune defaults, if CI budgets breach |

## 22. The leapfrog catalog

1. **One-binary installation** — no LaTeX, no Pango, no fontconfig, no Python: typesetting, rendering, and everything but final video encode in a single sovereign artifact. This was Rev 2's dream and is Rev 3's definition.
2. **Certified reproducible renders** (`--reproducible`) — bit-identical raw frames, canonical PNGs, and WAV from a content-hashed closure across the certified matrix, sidecar manifests included.
3. **Correct mathematics under the familiar names** — constant-speed paths, true lengths, drift-free clocks, defined color: the engine users thought they had.
4. **Native mathematics everywhere the suite reaches** — fmd-math serves FrankenManim scenes *and* fmd's HTML/PDF: one engine, every document.
5. **Runs anywhere** — headless servers, the WASM frame renderer and timeline player, a kitty/sixel TUI over SSH.
6. **The Studio** — supervised worker iteration with crash isolation, journal replay, scrubbing, inspection (span maps included), overlays; browser-local WASM endgame.
7. **Graph mobjects** (fnx) and **8. Data mobjects** (fp) — real structures, algorithm-driven animation, determinism rules included.
9. **Neural scenes** (ft) — real modules mid-training; differentiable animation held as exploratory research.
10. **MarkdownMobject** — fmd documents and slides, highlighted code and inline math, as animatable content.
11. **Batch farms** (asupersync) and **12. a governed supply chain** — pinned, allowlisted, per-package-audited, zero project-authored `unsafe` outside the binding crate.
13. **Farm-class scaling from a single scene** — pure-segment frame parallelism, pipelined stages, and topology-aware render teams saturate a 96-core workstation or an Apple Max part on one scene, while `certified` bits stay identical at any thread count (§9.5, §17).

## 23. Decision log & open questions

**Decisions (binding unless amended here).**
D-01 The contract is API/semantic compatibility + correctness + beauty; output identity with Python manim is a non-goal. D-02 **ffmpeg is the sole external tool**, optional, sandboxed, excluded from certified artifacts. D-03 **No LaTeX on any path**: mathematics is fmd-math, living as new workspace crates (`fmd-font`, `fmd-math`) in franken_markdown, governed like foundation crates. D-04 Lumen is one analytic renderer *semantically*, executed by multiple engines that share the IR and the tests (§10.1); the Reference's lighting, projection, palette, and AA feel are kept as the calibrated look. D-05 manim names carry correct semantics (arclength, clock, RNG, color), documented in the Behavior Notes. D-06 One RNG: PCG64DXSM with named substreams. D-07 The RationalFrameClock emits manim's nominal sample points exactly, in rational time. D-08 Default face: bundled Computer Modern; nothing depends on host fonts. D-09 Spans come from native layout provenance; the two-render alignment hack is dead; assignment matching remains for shape-based transforms only. D-10 De-TeX the incidental classes (§11.6). D-11 Arena + handles pending G0 ratification; the fluent API is what the prototype proves. D-12 Governed-closure doctrine (§3). D-13 Custom GLSL excluded from the compatibility claim; a short corpus-adapter list only. D-14 Supervisor + worker iteration; multipart-PNG Studio baseline. D-15 Exact pinned nightly; scalar-first as ordering; **SIMD is `std::simd` with safe `#[target_feature]` in build tiers** governed by SUITE.lock's certified target-feature sets, under the §10.5 lane rules — the abstraction is now named, and no per-call `unsafe` dispatch exists. D-16 Self-goldens are the regression gate; Reference imagery is reference. D-17 fmn-dmath owns certified transcendentals; fmn-hash owns content addressing. D-18 **The parallelism contract** (§10.5 a–f) binds every optimization; its three refusals — GPU in certified, variable frame sampling, completion-order RNG — are permanent. D-19 Frames freeze into immutable **FramePackets** after capture (§9.3); **pure segments** render frame-parallel (§9.5); execution pipelines behind a bounded, RAM-derived in-flight budget with ordered emit (§17.4). D-20 The render plan is **retained**: mandatory lazy revisioned mirrors, compiled-path caches, glyph/shape instancing, two-level binning, painter-safe occlusion pruning, and the retained compositor — in export and preview alike (§8.2, §10.8). D-21 **Adaptive coverage** replaces full-frame SSAA as the standard default; `certified` runs the canonical path everywhere (§10.4). D-22 The **Accelerator Annex** reaches GPUs only through frankentorch (Metal now; CUDA on the upstream ledger); no wgpu; never certified; PG-A-gated only; Studio preview first (§10.7). D-23 The output sink is **negotiated** (§14.3): native orientation and transfer, NV12/P010, hardware encoders as a standard-mode knob, asynchronous rings; `vflip`/`eq` are dead. D-24 Scheduling derives from introspected **HardwareTopology** via an **ExecutionPlan**; autotune caches are standard-only; certified runs its declared fixed configuration (§17.4).

**Open questions (owned; resolved at G0 or the named workstream).**
OQ-1 (G0-6) Floating + fmn-dmath vs fixed-point raster boundary for certification. OQ-2 (G0-3) Extensible delimiters: CM glyph assembly, drawn paths, or hybrid — and the metrics-synthesis calibration method. OQ-3 (W6) fmd workspace-conversion mechanics and release/versioning for the new crates. OQ-4 (W6) Text-mode TeX (`TexText`) surface breadth for tier-1. OQ-5 (W7) fnx layout-kernel audit outcome. OQ-6 (post-W1) Windows bit-certification. OQ-7 (W8) Container/codec surface beyond the Reference's. OQ-8 (banked) A restricted GLSL interpreter, only on demonstrated demand. OQ-9 (W10) Whether the gallery keeps any Strategy-B adapters or ships exclusions only. OQ-10 (G0-8) Whether CUDA-via-ft reaches annex quality now or waits on upstream ft device work — the ledger item's outcome decides. OQ-11 (W5) Render-team sizing priors per scene class — the autotuner's starting points (e.g. 3×32 vs 4×24 on 96 cores). OQ-12 (G3) Whether the annex-preview fallback is exercised (see G3's declared fallback and R21).

## Appendix B. The render plane: kept look vs replaced mechanism

| Reference GLSL artifact | Verified mechanism at the pin | Rev-3 disposition |
|---|---|---|
| quadratic_bezier/fill | interior + Loop–Blinn triangles; signed-alpha winding (`a→−0.95a/(1−0.95a)`, 0.95 cap); 2×-f16 canvas; ×1.06 composite; GL_MAX fill borders | **replaced**: analytic winding coverage, linear-light compositing, principled borders (§10.2); recorded here as reference only |
| quadratic_bezier/stroke | adaptive polyline ribbon ≤ 32 steps; cross-strip smoothstep; parameter-space width; butt caps; cosine-threshold auto joins | **replaced**: true curve-distance strokes, round caps, real joins, arclength width (§10.3) |
| quadratic_bezier/depth | separate depth pre-pass | **kept in spirit**: per-tile depth partition for depth-tested mobjects |
| surface / textured_surface | UV-grid tessellation; `finalize_color` `(reflectiveness, gloss, shadow)`; light (−10,10,10); `dark_shift=0.2` | **kept**: the lighting model is the look; ported exactly (§10.4) |
| true_dot / image | radial glow falloff; textured quads | **kept**: glow math and feel; bilinear sampling under the §10.6 policy |
| inserts/emit_gl_Position | projection constants; `gl_ClipDistance` | **kept**: projection model and clip planes (§10.4) |
| inserts/finalize_color, get_unit_normal | lighting; normals | **kept**: ported once, tested |
| anti-alias behavior | stroke smoothstep ~1.5 px; 2D via the fill canvas; MSAA 3D-only | **kept as feel**: the ~1.5 px AA weight and overall softness, delivered by analytic coverage + adaptive edge supersampling (§10.4), calibrated in the G0 look study |
| mandelbrot/newton folders; `set_color_by_code`; custom `shader_folder`s | arbitrary GLSL programmability | **scoped**: excluded from the compatibility claim; short corpus-adapter list per §15.4 |
| inserts/get_xyz_to_uv, complex_functions | vestigial / fractal-only at the pin | reference mathematics only |

## Appendix C. The Reference-defect register (Rev-3 rulings: fixed, with Behavior Notes)

With output parity dropped, every known Reference defect is simply **fixed**; each carries a Behavior Note so migrating users are never surprised.

| # | Defect at the pin | Ruling |
|---|---|---|
| C-1 | `TurnInsideOut` calls a nonexistent `refresh_triangulation` (AttributeError on any VMobject) | fixed — the evident intent implemented |
| C-2 | `get_scale_stroke_with_zoom()` reads the `flat_stroke` uniform | fixed |
| C-3 | `Line.get_arc_length` handles only positive `path_arc` | fixed — true arc length for all arcs (BN-03) |
| C-4 | `TexturedGeometry.init_points` triple-reads one slice (dead code) | not replicated |
| C-5 | `add_updater(call=True)` runs the update twice | fixed — runs once (BN, §8.6) |
| C-6 | `Group.__add__` mutates in place while `Mobject.__add__` returns new | fixed — consistent value semantics (BN, §8.6) |
| C-7 | `use_winding_fill` is a documented no-op; the earclip path is dead in the shipped fill | API accepted as a no-op for compatibility; our fill never needed it |
| C-8 | three inconsistent arc-density conventions; chord-heuristic length layer | unified density rule; true length (BN-03, BN-09) |
| C-9 | public-surface typos (`tickness_multiplier`, `char_to_cahced_mob`, `event_listner`) | canonical names in the schema; exact-name aliases in fmn-python |

*End of plan, Revision 4. The Reference now plays the role it always deserved: the source of the ideas, the API, and the aesthetic — not a pixel warden. One external tool remains, at the one boundary where owning the code would be vanity rather than sovereignty. Everything else — the geometry, the animation calculus, the renderer, and above all the mathematics on the screen — is ours, built to be correct and built to be beautiful. The first deliverable of W1 remains the harness that will judge everything after it; the boldest deliverable of the program still lives in franken_markdown, where every Franken document will share it. And the machine is finally allowed to be fast: the bits are pinned, the scheduler is free, and the same certified frame emerges whether one core produced it or ninety-six.*
